## What are Tools?
Tools are Python scripts provided to a LLM, during a request, enabling the LLM to perform specific actions or access additional context. To use Tools, the LLM must support **function calling**.

Tools enhance chat capabilities by supporting use cases like web search, web scraping, and API integrations. A variety of Tools are available on the [community website](https://openwebui.com/tools/) and can be easily integrated into your Open WebUI instance.

## What sorts of things can Tools do?
Tools empower LLMs with diverse functionalities to enrich interactive conversations, such as:

- [**Web Search**](https://openwebui.com/t/constliakos/web_search/): Fetch live, real-time information from the web.
- [**Image Generation**](https://openwebui.com/t/justinrahb/image_gen/): Create images based on user prompts.

## How to install Tools
There are two ways to install the tools:
### Import via your OpenWebUI URL
1) Navigate to the [community site](https://openwebui.com/tools/):
2) Click on the Tool you wish to import
3) Click the blue “Get” button in the top right-hand corner of the page
4) Enter the IP address of your OpenWebUI instance and click “Import to WebUI” which will automatically open your instance and allow you to import the Tool.
### Download and import manually
Navigate to the [community site](https://openwebui.com/tools/):
1) Click on the Tool you wish to import
2) Click the blue “Get” button in the top right-hand corner of the page
3) Click “Download as JSON export”
4) You can now upload the Tool into OpenWebUI by navigating to Workspace => Tools and clicking “Import Tools”

Note: You can install your own Tools and other Tools not tracked on the community site using the manual import method. Please do not import Tools you do not understand or are not from a trustworthy source. Running unknown code is ALWAYS a risk.

## How to set Valves and User Valves
Valves and User Valves are configuration options that allow admins and users to customize how Tools behave.

### Valves
Valves are variables set by **admin** to adjust Tool behavior globally. You can use valves to set default configurations, such as rate limits, API keys, or specific parameters relevant to your Tool.
### How to Configure Valves?
>**Note:** Only admins can chabge the values for Valves
1. Open the **Tool** section in your **Workspace** instance.
2. Locate the Valves section (⚙️).
3. Adjust the default values based on your requirements.

### User Valves:
User Valves are customizable variables that can be modified by individual users to tailor the Tool to their needs.
### How to Configure User Valves?
1. In the main interface, locate the Control Panel in the top corner.
2. In the valve section, choose the Tool you want to configure. If the Tool has User Valves, they will appear here.
3. Adjust the values based on your requirements.

## How to use the tools?
[**After installation**](#how-to-install-tools), to enabled Tools during a chat, click the “+” icon in the chat interface to access and use available Tools.

>**Note:** Enabling a Tool doesn't force it to be used but allows the LLM to call it as needed.

It is possible to assign a tool to a model, which ensures that the tool is automatically enabled by default whenever the model is selected. 
To assign the tool to the model:
1. Navigate to Admin Panel => setting => Models in OpenWebUI.
2. Select the model for which you want to enable Tools.
3. Click the pencil icon to edit the model's settings.
4. Scroll to the Tools section and check the boxes for the Tools you wish to enable.
5. Save your changes.

### Understanding Parameters
To effectively use a Tool, it’s important to understand the parameters it requires in your message for the LLM to utilize the Tool correctly. Each Tool defines its expected inputs and outputs in its manifest and function docstrings.

1. Check the Tool Manifest:
Open the Tool file and review the manifest section.
This section provides metadata about the Tool, including its name, description, and input/output parameters.

2. Review Function Docstrings:
Each function in the Tool includes a Sphinx-style docstring that describes the expected inputs, types, and outputs.

For example, if you are using a Tool designed to calculate an equation, your message must include the required parameter, in this case, the equation itself, for the Tool to be invoked successfully.

```python
"""
        Calculate the result of an equation.
        :param equation: The equation to calculate.
"""
```
