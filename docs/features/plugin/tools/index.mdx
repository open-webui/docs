# What are Tools?

⚙️ Tools are the various ways you can extend an LLM's capabilities beyond simple text generation. When enabled, they allow your chatbot to do amazing things — like search the web, scrape data, generate images, talk back using AI voices, and more.

Because there are several ways to integrate "Tools" in Open WebUI, it's important to understand which type you are using.

---

## Tooling Taxonomy: Which "Tool" are you using?

🧩 Users often encounter the term "Tools" in different contexts. Here is how to distinguish them:

| Type | Location in UI | Best For... | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Native Features** | Admin/Settings | Core platform functionality | Built-in to Open WebUI |
| **Workspace Tools** | `Workspace > Tools` | User-created or community Python scripts | [Community Library](https://openwebui.com/search) |
| **Native MCP (HTTP)** | `Settings > Connections` | Standard MCP servers reachable via HTTP/SSE | External MCP Servers |
| **MCP via Proxy (MCPO)** | `Settings > Connections` | Local stdio-based MCP servers (e.g., Claude Desktop tools) | [MCPO Adapter](https://github.com/open-webui/mcpo) |
| **OpenAPI Servers** | `Settings > Connections` | Standard REST/OpenAPI web services | External Web APIs |

### 1. Native Features (Built-in)
These are deeply integrated into Open WebUI and generally don't require external scripts.
- **Web Search**: Integrated via engines like SearXNG, Google, or Tavily.
- **URL Fetching**: Extract text content directly from websites using `#` or native tools.
- **Image Generation**: Integrated with DALL-E, ComfyUI, or Automatic1111.
- **Memory**: The ability for models to remember facts about you across chats.
- **RAG (Knowledge)**: The ability to query uploaded documents (`#`).

In [**Native Mode**](#built-in-system-tools-nativeagentic-mode), these features are exposed as **Tools** that the model can call independently.

### 2. Workspace Tools (Custom Plugins)
These are **Python scripts** that run directly within the Open WebUI environment.
- **Capability**: Can do anything Python can do (web scraping, complex math, API calls).
- **Access**: Managed via the `Workspace` menu. 
- **Safety**: Always review code before importing, as these run on your server.
- **⚠️ Security Warning**: Normal or untrusted users should **not** be given permission to access the Workspace Tools section. This access allows a user to upload and execute arbitrary Python code on your server, which could lead to a full system compromise.

### 3. MCP (Model Context Protocol)

🔌 MCP is an open standard that allows LLMs to interact with external data and tools.
- **Native HTTP MCP**: Open WebUI can connect directly to any MCP server that exposes an HTTP/SSE endpoint.
- **MCPO (Proxy)**: Most community MCP servers use `stdio` (local command line). To use these in Open WebUI, you use the [**MCPO Proxy**](../../plugin/tools/openapi-servers/mcp.mdx) to bridge the connection.

### 4. OpenAPI / Function Calling Servers
Generic web servers that provide an OpenAPI (`.json` or `.yaml`) specification. Open WebUI can ingest these specs and treat every endpoint as a tool.

## How to Install & Manage Workspace Tools

📦 Workspace Tools are the most common way to extend your instance with community features.

1. Go to [Community Tool Library](https://openwebui.com/search)
2. Choose a Tool, then click the **Get** button.
3. Enter your Open WebUI instance’s URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`).
4. Click **Import to WebUI**.

:::warning Safety Tip
Never import a Tool you don’t recognize or trust. These are Python scripts and might run unsafe code on your host system. **Crucially, ensure you only grant "Tool" permissions to trusted users**, as the ability to create or import tools is equivalent to the ability to run arbitrary code on the server.

## How to Use Tools in Chat

🔧 Once installed or connected, here’s how to enable them for your conversations:

### Option 1: Enable on-the-fly (Specific Chat)
While chatting, click the **➕ (plus)** icon in the input area. You’ll see a list of available Tools — you can enable them specifically for that session.

### Option 2: Enable by Default (Global/Model Level)
1. Go to **Workspace ➡️ Models**.
2. Choose the model you’re using and click the ✏️ edit icon.
3. Scroll to the **Tools** section.
4. ✅ Check the Tools you want this model to always have access to by default.
5. Click **Save**.

You can also let your LLM auto-select the right Tools using the [**AutoTool Filter**](https://openwebui.com/f/hub/autotool_filter/).

## Tool Calling Modes: Default vs. Native

Open WebUI offers two distinct ways for models to interact with tools: a standard **Default Mode** and a high-performance **Native Mode (Agentic Mode)**. Choosing the right mode depends on your model's capabilities and your performance requirements.

### 🟡 Default Mode (Prompt-based)
In Default Mode, Open WebUI manages tool selection by injecting a specific prompt template that guides the model to output a tool request.
- **Compatibility**: Works with **practically any model**, including older or smaller local models that lack native function-calling support.
- **Flexibility**: Highly customizable via prompt templates.
- **Caveat**: Can be slower (requires extra tokens) and less reliable for complex, multi-step tool chaining.

### 🟢 Native Mode (Agentic Mode / System Function Calling)
Native Mode (also called **Agentic Mode**) leverages the model's built-in capability to handle tool definitions and return structured tool calls (JSON). This is the **recommended mode** for high-performance agentic workflows.

:::warning Model Quality Matters
**Agentic tool calling requires high-quality models to work reliably.** While small local models may technically support function calling, they often struggle with the complex reasoning required for multi-step tool usage. For best results, use frontier models like **GPT-5**, **Claude 4.5 Sonnet**, **Gemini 3 Flash**, or **MiniMax M2.1**. Small local models may produce malformed JSON or fail to follow the strict state management required for agentic behavior.
:::

#### Why use Native Mode (Agentic Mode)?
- **Speed & Efficiency**: Lower latency as it avoids bulky prompt-based tool selection.
- **Reliability**: Higher accuracy in following tool schemas (with quality models).
- **Multi-step Chaining**: Essential for **Agentic Research** and **Interleaved Thinking** where a model needs to call multiple tools in succession.
- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Models can decide when to search, which tools to use, and how to combine results.

#### How to Enable Native Mode (Agentic Mode)
Native Mode can be enabled at two levels:

1.  **Global/Administrator Level (Recommended)**:
    *   Navigate to **Admin Panel > Settings > Models**.
    *   Scroll to **Model Specific Settings** for your target model.
    *   Under **Advanced Parameters**, find the **Function Calling** dropdown and select `Native`.
2.  **Per-Chat Basis**:
    *   Inside a chat, click the ⚙️ **Chat Controls** icon.
    *   Go to **Advanced Params** and set **Function Calling** to `Native`.

#### Model Requirements & Caveats

:::tip Recommended Models for Agentic Mode
For reliable agentic tool calling, use high-tier frontier models:
- **GPT-5** (OpenAI)
- **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** (Anthropic)
- **Gemini 3 Flash** (Google)
- **MiniMax M2.1**

These models excel at multi-step reasoning, proper JSON formatting, and autonomous tool selection.
:::

- **Large Local Models**: Some large local models (e.g., Qwen 3 32B, Llama 3.3 70B) can work with Native Mode, but results vary significantly by model quality.
- **Small Local Models Warning**: **Small local models** (under 30B parameters) often struggle with Native Mode. They may produce malformed JSON, fail to follow strict state management, or make poor tool selection decisions. For these models, **Default Mode** is usually more reliable.

| Feature | Default Mode | Native Mode |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Latency** | Medium/High | Low |
| **Model Compatibility** | Universal | Requires Tool-Calling Support |
| **Logic** | Prompt-based (Open WebUI) | Model-native (API/Ollama) |
| **Complex Chaining** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Excellent |

### Built-in System Tools (Native/Agentic Mode)

🛠️ When **Native Mode (Agentic Mode)** is enabled, Open WebUI automatically injects powerful system tools based on the features toggled for the chat. This unlocks truly agentic behaviors where capable models (like GPT-5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 3 Flash, or MiniMax M2.1) can perform multi-step research, explore knowledge bases, or manage user memory autonomously.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|

:::info Automatic Timezone Detection
Open WebUI automatically detects and stores your timezone when you log in. This allows time-related tools and features to provide accurate local times without any manual configuration. Your timezone is determined from your browser settings.
:::

:::tip Four-Layer Tool Control
Feature-specific tools (Web Search, Image Generation, Code Interpreter) require **all four conditions** to be met:

1. **Feature enabled globally** (e.g., **Admin Panel > Settings > Web Search / Code Execution / Images**)
2. **Builtin Tools** capability ON for the model
3. **Feature-specific capability** ON for the model (e.g., `web_search`)
4. **Chat toggle** enabled for the feature

**Enabling Features by Default:**
- **Admins:** Go to **Admin Panel > Settings > Models**, select a model, and scroll to **Default Features**. Toggle on the desired features so they're pre-enabled for new chats.
- **Users:** Go to **Settings > Interface** and set **Web Search** to **Always**.
:::

:::tip Knowledge Base Tools vs RAG Pipeline
The native `query_knowledge_files` tool uses **simple vector search** with a default of 5 results. It does **not** use:
- Hybrid search (BM25 + vector)
- Reranking (external reranker endpoint)
- The "Top K Reranker" admin setting

For the full RAG pipeline with hybrid search and reranking, use the **File Context** capability (attach files via `#` or knowledge base assignment) instead of relying on autonomous tool calls.
:::

**Why use these?** It allows for **Deep Research** (searching the web multiple times, or querying knowledge bases), **Contextual Awareness** (looking up previous chats or notes), **Dynamic Personalization** (saving facts), and **Precise Automation** (generating content based on existing notes or documents).

#### Disabling Builtin Tools (Per-Model)

The **Builtin Tools** capability can be toggled on or off for each model in the **Workspace > Models** editor under **Capabilities**. When enabled (the default), all the system tools listed above are automatically injected when using Native Mode.

**When to disable Builtin Tools:**

| Scenario | Reason to Disable |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Model doesn't support function calling** | Smaller or older models may not handle the `tools` parameter correctly |
| **Simpler/predictable behavior needed** | You want the model to work only with pre-injected context, no autonomous tool calls |
| **Security/control concerns** | Prevents the model from actively querying knowledge bases, searching chats, accessing memories, etc. |
| **Token efficiency** | Tool specifications consume tokens; disabling saves context window space |

**What happens when Builtin Tools is disabled:**

1. **No tool injection**: The model won't receive any of the built-in system tools, even in Native Mode.
2. **RAG still works** (if File Context is enabled): Attached files are still processed via RAG and injected as context.
3. **No autonomous retrieval**: The model cannot decide to search knowledge bases or fetch additional information—it works only with what's provided upfront.

:::tip Builtin Tools vs File Context
**Builtin Tools** controls whether the model gets *tools* for autonomous retrieval. It does **not** control whether file content is injected via RAG—that's controlled by the separate **File Context** capability.

- **File Context** = Whether Open WebUI extracts and injects file content (RAG processing)
- **Builtin Tools** = Whether the model gets tools to autonomously search/retrieve additional content

See [File Context vs Builtin Tools](../../rag/index.md#file-context-vs-builtin-tools) for a detailed comparison.
:::

### Interleaved Thinking {#interleaved-thinking}

🧠 When using **Native Mode (Agentic Mode)**, high-tier models can engage in **Interleaved Thinking**. This is a powerful "Thought → Action → Thought → Action → Thought → ..." loop where the model can reason about a task, execute one or more tools, evaluate the results, and then decide on its next move.

:::info Quality Models Required
Interleaved thinking requires models with strong reasoning capabilities. This feature works best with frontier models (GPT-5, Claude 4.5+, Gemini 3+) that can maintain context across multiple tool calls and make intelligent decisions about which tools to use when.
:::

This is fundamentally different from a single-shot tool call. In an interleaved workflow, the model follows a cycle:
1.  **Reason**: Analyze the user's intent and identify information gaps.
2.  **Act**: Call a tool (e.g., `query_knowledge_files` for internal docs or `search_web` and `fetch_url` for web research).
3.  **Think**: Read the tool's output and update its internal understanding.
4.  **Iterate**: If the answer isn't clear, call another tool (e.g., `view_knowledge_file` to read a specific document or `fetch_url` to read a specific page) or refine the search.
5.  **Finalize**: Only after completing this "Deep Research" cycle does the model provide a final, grounded answer.

This behavior is what transforms a standard chatbot into an **Agentic AI** capable of solving complex, multi-step problems autonomously.
