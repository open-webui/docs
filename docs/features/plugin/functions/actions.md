Action functions allow you to write custom buttons to the message toolbar for end users to interact
with. This feature enables more interactive messaging, enabling users to grant permission before a
task is performed, generate visualizations of structured data, download an audio snippet of chats,
and many other use cases.

A scaffold of Action code can be found [in the community section](https://openwebui.com/f/hub/custom_action/).

An example of a graph visualization Action can be seen in the video below.
