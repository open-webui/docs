## Shared Function Components

### Valves and UserValves - (optional, but HIGHLY encouraged)

Valves and UserValves are used to allow users to provide dynamic details such as an API key or a configuration option. These will create a fillable field or a bool switch in the GUI menu for the given function.

Valves are configurable by admins alone via the Tools or Functions menus. On the other hand UserValves are configurable by any users directly from a chat session.

```
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# Define and Valves
class Filter:
    # Notice the current indentation: Valves and UserValves must be declared as
    # attributes of a Tools, Filter or Pipe class. Here we take the
    # example of a Filter.
    class Valves(BaseModel):
        # Valves and UserValves inherit from pydantic's BaseModel. This
        # enables complex use cases like model validators etc.
        test_valve: int = Field(  # Notice the type hint: it is used to
            # choose the kind of UI element to show the user (buttons,
            # texts, etc).
            default=4,
            description="A valve controlling a numberical value"
            # required=False,  # you can enforce fields using True
        )
        priority: int = Field(
            default=0,
            description="Priority level for the filter operations. Lower values are passed through first"
        )
        # The priority field is optional but if present will be used to
        # order the Filters.
        pass
        # Note that this 'pass' helps for parsing and is recommended.

    # UserValves are defined the same way.
    class UserValves(BaseModel):
        test_user_valve: bool = Field(
            default=False, description="A user valve controlling a True/False (on/off) switch"
        )
        pass

    def __init__(self):
        self.valves = self.Valves()
        # Because they are set by the admin, they are accessible directly
        # upon code execution.
        pass

    # The inlet method is only used for Filter but the __user__ handling is the same
    def inlet(self, body: dict, __user__: dict):
        # Because UserValves are defined per user they are only available
        # on use.
        # Note that although __user__ is a dict, __user__["valves"] is a
        # UserValves object. Hence you can access values like that:
        test_user_valve = __user__["valves"].test_user_valve
        # Or:
        test_user_valve = dict(__user__["valves"])["test_user_valve"]
        # But this will return the default value instead of the actual value:
        # test_user_valve = __user__["valves"]["test_user_valve"]  # Do not do that!

### Event Emitters
Event Emitters are used to add additional information to the chat interface. Similarly to Filter Outlets, Event Emitters are capable of appending content to the chat. Unlike Filter Outlets, they are not capable of stripping information. Additionally, emitters can be activated at any stage during the function.

There are two different types of Event Emitters:

#### Status
This is used to add statuses to a message while it is performing steps. These can be done at any stage during the Function. These statuses appear right above the message content. These are very useful for Functions that delay the LLM response or process large amounts of information. This allows you to inform users what is being processed in real-time.

```
await __event_emitter__(
            {
                "type": "status", # We set the type here
                "data": {"description": "Message that shows up in the chat", "done": False}, 
                # Note done is False here indicating we are still emitting statuses
            }
        )
```

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```
async def test_function(
        self, prompt: str, __user__: dict, __event_emitter__=None
    ) -> str:
        """
        This is a demo

        :param test: this is a test parameter
        """

        await __event_emitter__(
            {
                "type": "status", # We set the type here
                "data": {"description": "Message that shows up in the chat", "done": False}, 
                # Note done is False here indicating we are still emitting statuses
            }
        )

        # Do some other logic here
        await __event_emitter__(
            {
                "type": "status",
                "data": {"description": "Completed a task message", "done": True},
                # Note done is True here indicating we are done emitting statuses
            }
        )

        except Exception as e:
            await __event_emitter__(
                {
                    "type": "status",
                    "data": {"description": f"An error occured: {e}", "done": True},
                }
            )

            return f"Tell the user: {e}"
```
</details>

#### Message
This type is used to append a message to the LLM at any stage in the Function. This means that you can append messages, embed images, and even render web pages before, or after, or during the LLM response.

```
await __event_emitter__(
                    {
                        "type": "message", # We set the type here
                        "data": {"content": "This message will be appended to the chat."},
                        # Note that with message types we do NOT have to set a done condition
                    }
                )
```

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```
async def test_function(
        self, prompt: str, __user__: dict, __event_emitter__=None
    ) -> str:
        """

        :param test: this is a test parameter

                        "data": {"content": "This message will be appended to the chat."},
                        # Note that with message types we do NOT have to set a done condition
                    }
                )

        except Exception as e:
            await __event_emitter__(
                {
                    "type": "status",
                    "data": {"description": f"An error occured: {e}", "done": True},
                }
            )

            return f"Tell the user: {e}"
