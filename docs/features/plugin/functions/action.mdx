Action functions allow you to write custom buttons to the message toolbar for end users to interact
with. This feature enables more interactive messaging, enabling users to grant permission before a
task is performed, generate visualizations of structured data, download an audio snippet of chats,
and many other use cases.

A scaffold of Action code can be found [in the community section](https://openwebui.com/f/hub/custom_action/).

An example of a graph visualization Action can be seen in the video below.

### Action
Actions are used to create a button in the Message UI (the small buttons found directly underneath individual chat messages).

Actions have a single main component called an action function. This component takes an object defining the type of action and the data being processed.

```
async def action(
        self,
        body: dict,
        __user__=None,
        __event_emitter__=None,
        __event_call__=None,
    ) -> Optional[dict]:
        print(f"action:{__name__}")

        response = await __event_call__(
            {
                "type": "input",
                "data": {
                    "title": "write a message",
                    "message": "here write a message to append",
                    "placeholder": "enter your message",
                },
            }
        )
        print(response)
```
