# üîß Functions 

Just started with Open WebUI or finding yourself wondering, "What exactly are functions, and how do they fit in here?" Let‚Äôs unravel it together! Functions are designed to add flexibility and control directly within Open WebUI, allowing you to expand its functionality without the hassle of complex external setups. üöÄ

## TL;DR
- **Functions** are like built-in enhancements for Open WebUI, letting you add custom processing, filtering, and even interactivity without needing external tools. üõ†Ô∏è
- Functions help WebUI handle tasks like formatting, visualizations, or creating interactive elements. üìä
- **Types of Functions** include Filters, Actions, Pipes, each offering a unique way to enhance or control Open WebUI‚Äôs behavior.

Using Functions is straightforward! Once you've installed one, it‚Äôs just a matter of enabling it per model or globally for all models. You‚Äôre now ready to get creative with how WebUI processes data! üé®

## What are Functions? ü§î
Think of **Functions** as ways to teach Open WebUI some new skills‚Äînot for AI model answers but for WebUI‚Äôs internal workings. Functions let you configure processes like filtering messages, formatting text, or even creating interactive chat features.

### Why Use Functions? üîç
Functions are your go-to for customizing the WebUI‚Äôs behavior or adding new ways to interact with AI models.

### Examples of Functions:
1. **Add new AI models** to your setup, such as Anthropic ü§ñ.
2. **Set up message filters** to weed out inappropriate content. üö´
3. **Create custom buttons** that perform specific actions in the chat. üîò

Functions make Open WebUI more dynamic, keeping it flexible for whatever you need it to do! Dive into the next sections to learn more about each function type.

## How can I use Functions? üíª
Functions can be used, [once installed](#how-to-install-functions), by assigning them to an LLM or enabling them globally. Some function types will always be enabled globally, such as manifolds. To assign a function to a model, you simply need to navigate to **Workspace => Models**. Here you can select the model for which you‚Äôd like to enable any Functions. 

Once you click the pencil icon ‚úèÔ∏è to edit the model settings, scroll down to the Functions section and check any Functions you wish to enable. Once done, click **Save** üíæ.

You also have the ability to enable Functions globally for ALL models. In order to do this, navigate to **Workspace => Functions** and click the "..." menu. Once the menu opens, simply enable the **Global** switch üåê, and your function will be enabled for every model in your OpenWebUI instance.
