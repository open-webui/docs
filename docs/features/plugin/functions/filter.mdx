### Filter
Filters are used to manipulate the user input and/or the LLM output to add, remove, format, or otherwise adjust the content of the body object.

Filters have a few main components:

#### Inlet Function
The inlet is user to pre-process a user input before it is send to the LLM for processing. 

#### Outlet Function
The outlet is used to post-process the output from the LLM. It is important to note that when you perform actions such as stripping/replacing content, this will happen after the output is rendered to the UI.
