# ü™Ñ Filter Function: Modify Inputs and Outputs

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Filter Functions in Open WebUI! Filters are a flexible and powerful **plugin system** for modifying data *before it's sent to the Large Language Model (LLM)* (input) or *after it‚Äôs returned from the LLM* (output). Whether you‚Äôre transforming inputs for better context or cleaning up outputs for improved readability, **Filter Functions** let you do it all.  

This guide will break down **what Filters are**, how they work, their structure, and everything you need to know to build powerful and user-friendly filters of your own. Let‚Äôs dig in, and don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîI‚Äôll use metaphors, examples, and tips to make everything crystal clear! üåü

## üåä What Are Filters in Open WebUI?

Imagine Open WebUI as a **stream of water** flowing through pipes:

- **User inputs** and **LLM outputs** are the water.
- **Filters** are the **water treatment stages** that clean, modify, and adapt the water before it reaches the final destination.

Filters sit in the middle of the flow‚Äîlike checkpoints‚Äîwhere you decide what needs to be adjusted.

Here‚Äôs a quick summary of what Filters do:

1. **Modify User Inputs (Inlet Function)**: Tweak the input data before it reaches the AI model. This is where you enhance clarity, add context, sanitize text, or reformat messages to match specific requirements.
2. **Intercept Model Outputs (Stream Function)**: Capture and adjust the AI‚Äôs responses **as they‚Äôre generated** by the model. This is useful for real-time modifications, like filtering out sensitive information or formatting the output for better readability.
3. **Modify Model Outputs (Outlet Function)**: Adjust the AI's response **after it‚Äôs processed**, before showing it to the user. This can help refine, log, or adapt the data for a cleaner user experience.

> **Key Concept:** Filters are not standalone models but tools that enhance or transform the data traveling *to* and *from* models.  

Filters are like **translators or editors** in the AI workflow: you can intercept and change the conversation without interrupting the flow.

## üó∫Ô∏è Structure of a Filter Function: The Skeleton

Let's start with the simplest representation of a Filter Function. Don't worry if some parts feel technical at first‚Äîwe‚Äôll break it all down step by step!

### ü¶¥ Basic Skeleton of a Filter

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class Filter:
    # Valves: Configuration options for the filter
    class Valves(BaseModel):  
        pass

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize valves (optional configuration for the Filter)
        self.valves = self.Valves()

    def inlet(self, body: dict) -> dict:
        # This is where you manipulate user inputs.
        print(f"inlet called: {body}")
        return body  

    def stream(self, event: dict) -> dict:
        # This is where you modify streamed chunks of model output.
        print(f"stream event: {event}")
        return event

    def outlet(self, body: dict) -> None:
        # This is where you manipulate model outputs.
        print(f"outlet called: {body}")
```

### üÜï üß≤ Toggle Filter Example: Adding Interactivity and Icons (New in Open WebUI 0.6.10)

Filters can do more than simply modify text‚Äîthey can expose UI toggles and display custom icons. For instance, you might want a filter that can be turned on/off with a user interface button, and displays a special icon in Open WebUI‚Äôs message input UI.

Here‚Äôs how you could create such a toggle filter:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional

class Filter:
    class Valves(BaseModel):
        pass

    def __init__(self):
        self.valves = self.Valves()
        self.toggle = True # IMPORTANT: This creates a switch UI in Open WebUI
        # TIP: Use SVG Data URI!
        self.icon = """data:image/svg+xml;base64,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"""
        pass

    async def inlet(
        self, body: dict, __event_emitter__, __user__: Optional[dict] = None
    ) -> dict:
        await __event_emitter__(
            {
                "type": "status",
                "data": {
                    "description": "Toggled!",
                    "done": True,
                    "hidden": False,
                },
            }
        )
        return body
```

#### üñºÔ∏è What‚Äôs happening?
- **toggle = True** creates a switch UI in Open WebUI‚Äîusers can manually enable or disable the filter in real time.
- **icon** (with a Data URI) will show up as a little image next to the filter‚Äôs name. You can use any SVG as long as it‚Äôs Data URI encoded!
- **The `inlet` function** uses the `__event_emitter__` special argument to broadcast feedback/status to the UI, such as a little toast/notification that reads "Toggled!"

You can use these mechanisms to make your filters dynamic, interactive, and visually unique within Open WebUI‚Äôs plugin ecosystem.

### üéØ Key Components Explained

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **`Valves` Class (Optional Settings)**

Think of **Valves** as the knobs and sliders for your filter. If you want to give users configurable options to adjust your Filter‚Äôs behavior, you define those here.

```python
class Valves(BaseModel):
    OPTION_NAME: str = "Default Value"
```

For example:  
If you're creating a filter that converts responses into uppercase, you might allow users to configure whether every output gets totally capitalized via a valve like `TRANSFORM_UPPERCASE: bool = True/False`.


##### Configuring Valves with Dropdown Menus (Enums)

You can enhance the user experience for your filter's settings by providing dropdown menus instead of free-form text inputs for certain `Valves`. This is achieved using `json_schema_extra` with the `enum` keyword in your Pydantic `Field` definitions.

The `enum` keyword allows you to specify a list of predefined values that the UI should present as options in a dropdown.

**Example:** Creating a dropdown for color themes in a filter.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional

# Define your available options (e.g., color themes)
COLOR_THEMES = {
    "Plain (No Color)": [],
    "Monochromatic Blue": ["blue", "RoyalBlue", "SteelBlue", "LightSteelBlue"],
    "Warm & Energetic": ["orange", "red", "magenta", "DarkOrange"],
    "Cool & Calm": ["cyan", "blue", "green", "Teal", "CadetBlue"],
    "Forest & Earth": ["green", "DarkGreen", "LimeGreen", "OliveGreen"],
    "Mystical Purple": ["purple", "DarkOrchid", "MediumPurple", "Lavender"],
    "Grayscale": ["gray", "DarkGray", "LightGray"],
    "Rainbow Fun": [
        "red",
        "orange",
        "yellow",
        "green",
        "blue",
        "indigo",
        "violet",
    ],
    "Ocean Breeze": ["blue", "cyan", "LightCyan", "DarkTurquoise"],
    "Sunset Glow": ["DarkRed", "DarkOrange", "Orange", "gold"],
    "Custom Sequence (See Code)": [],
}

class Filter:
    class Valves(BaseModel):
        selected_theme: str = Field(
            "Monochromatic Blue",
            description="Choose a predefined color theme for LLM responses. 'Plain (No Color)' disables coloring.",
            json_schema_extra={"enum": list(COLOR_THEMES.keys())}, # KEY: This creates the dropdown
        )
        custom_colors_csv: str = Field(
            "",
            description="CSV of colors for 'Custom Sequence' theme (e.g., 'red,blue,green'). Uses xcolor names.",
        )
        strip_existing_latex: bool = Field(
            True,
            description="If true, attempts to remove existing LaTeX color commands. Recommended to avoid nested rendering issues.",
        )
        colorize_type: str = Field(
            "sequential_word",
            description="How to apply colors: 'sequential_word' (word by word), 'sequential_line' (line by line), 'per_letter' (letter by letter), 'full_message' (entire message).",
            json_schema_extra={
                "enum": [
                    "sequential_word",
                    "sequential_line",
                    "per_letter",
                    "full_message",
                ]
            }, # Another example of an enum dropdown
        )
        color_cycle_reset_per_message: bool = Field(
            True,
            description="If true, the color sequence restarts for each new LLM response message. If false, it continues across messages.",
        )
        debug_logging: bool = Field(
            False,
            description="Enable verbose logging to the console for debugging filter operations.",
        )

    def __init__(self):
        self.valves = self.Valves()
        # ... rest of your __init__ logic ...
```

**What's happening?**

*   **`json_schema_extra`**: This argument in `Field` allows you to inject arbitrary JSON Schema properties that Pydantic doesn't explicitly support but can be used by downstream tools (like Open WebUI's UI renderer).
*   **`"enum": list(COLOR_THEMES.keys())`**: This tells Open WebUI that the `selected_theme` field should present a selection of values, specifically the keys from our `COLOR_THEMES` dictionary. The UI will then render a dropdown menu with "Plain (No Color)", "Monochromatic Blue", "Warm & Energetic", etc., as selectable options.
*   The `colorize_type` field also demonstrates another `enum` dropdown for different coloring methods.

Using `enum` for your `Valves` options makes your filters more user-friendly and prevents invalid inputs, leading to a smoother configuration experience.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **`inlet` Function (Input Pre-Processing)**


The `inlet` function is like **prepping food before cooking**. Imagine you‚Äôre a chef: before the ingredients go into the recipe (the LLM in this case), you might wash vegetables, chop onions, or season the meat. Without this step, your final dish could lack flavor, have unwashed produce, or simply be inconsistent.

In the world of Open WebUI, the `inlet` function does this important prep work on the **user input** before it‚Äôs sent to the model. It ensures the input is as clean, contextual, and helpful as possible for the AI to handle.  

üì• **Input**:  
- **`body`**: The raw input from Open WebUI to the model. It is in the format of a chat-completion request (usually a dictionary that includes fields like the conversation's messages, model settings, and other metadata). Think of this as your recipe ingredients.

üöÄ **Your Task**:  
Modify and return the `body`. The modified version of the `body` is what the LLM works with, so this is your chance to bring clarity, structure, and context to the input.


##### üç≥ Why Would You Use the `inlet`?
1. **Adding Context**: Automatically append crucial information to the user‚Äôs input, especially if their text is vague or incomplete. For example, you might add "You are a friendly assistant" or "Help this user troubleshoot a software bug."
   
2. **Formatting Data**: If the input requires a specific format, like JSON or Markdown, you can transform it before sending it to the model.

3. **Sanitizing Input**: Remove unwanted characters, strip potentially harmful or confusing symbols (like excessive whitespace or emojis), or replace sensitive information.

4. **Streamlining User Input**: If your model‚Äôs output improves with additional guidance, you can use the `inlet` to inject clarifying instructions automatically!


##### üí° Example Use Cases: Build on Food Prep
###### ü•ó Example 1: Adding System Context
Let‚Äôs say the LLM is a chef preparing a dish for Italian cuisine, but the user hasn‚Äôt mentioned "This is for Italian cooking." You can ensure the message is clear by appending this context before sending the data to the model.

```python
def inlet(self, body: dict, __user__: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict:
    # Add system message for Italian context in the conversation
    context_message = {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are helping the user prepare an Italian meal."
    }
    # Insert the context at the beginning of the chat history
    body.setdefault("messages", []).insert(0, context_message)
    return body
```

üìñ **What Happens?**
- Any user input like "What are some good dinner ideas?" now carries the Italian theme because we‚Äôve set the system context! Cheesecake might not show up as an answer, but pasta sure will.


###### üî™ Example 2: Cleaning Input (Remove Odd Characters)
Suppose the input from the user looks messy or includes unwanted symbols like `!!!`, making the conversation inefficient or harder for the model to parse. You can clean it up while preserving the core content.

```python
def inlet(self, body: dict, __user__: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict:
    # Clean the last user input (from the end of the 'messages' list)
    last_message = body["messages"][-1]["content"]
    body["messages"][-1]["content"] = last_message.replace("!!!", "").strip()
    return body
```

üìñ **What Happens?**
- Before: `"How can I debug this issue!!!"` ‚û°Ô∏è Sent to the model as `"How can I debug this issue"`

:::note
Note: The user feels the same, but the model processes a cleaner and easier-to-understand query.
:::

##### üìä How `inlet` Helps Optimize Input for the LLM:
- Improves **accuracy** by clarifying ambiguous queries.
- Makes the AI **more efficient** by removing unnecessary noise like emojis, HTML tags, or extra punctuation.
- Ensures **consistency** by formatting user input to match the model‚Äôs expected patterns or schemas (like, say, JSON for a specific use case).


üí≠ **Think of `inlet` as the sous-chef in your kitchen**‚Äîensuring everything that goes into the model (your AI "recipe") has been prepped, cleaned, and seasoned to perfection. The better the input, the better the output!

---

#### üÜï 3Ô∏è‚É£ **`stream` Hook (New in Open WebUI 0.5.17)**

##### üîÑ What is the `stream` Hook?
The **`stream` function** is a new feature introduced in Open WebUI **0.5.17** that allows you to **intercept and modify streamed model responses** in real time.

Unlike `outlet`, which processes an entire completed response, `stream` operates on **individual chunks** as they are received from the model.

##### üõ†Ô∏è When to Use the Stream Hook?
- Modify **streaming responses** before they are displayed to users.
- Implement **real-time censorship or cleanup**.
- **Monitor streamed data** for logging/debugging.

##### üìú Example: Logging Streaming Chunks

Here‚Äôs how you can inspect and modify streamed LLM responses:
```python
def stream(self, event: dict) -> dict:
    print(event)  # Print each incoming chunk for inspection
    return event
```

> **Example Streamed Events:**
```jsonl
{"id": "chatcmpl-B4l99MMaP3QLGU5uV7BaBM0eDS0jb","choices": [{"delta": {"content": "Hi"}}]}
{"id": "chatcmpl-B4l99MMaP3QLGU5uV7BaBM0eDS0jb","choices": [{"delta": {"content": "!"}}]}
{"id": "chatcmpl-B4l99MMaP3QLGU5uV7BaBM0eDS0jb","choices": [{"delta": {"content": " üòä"}}]}
```
üìñ **What Happens?**
- Each line represents a **small fragment** of the model's streamed response.
- The **`delta.content` field** contains the progressively generated text.

##### üîÑ Example: Filtering Out Emojis from Streamed Data
```python
def stream(self, event: dict) -> dict:
    for choice in event.get("choices", []):
        delta = choice.get("delta", {})
        if "content" in delta:
            delta["content"] = delta["content"].replace("üòä", "")  # Strip emojis
    return event
```
üìñ **Before:** `"Hi üòä"`  
üìñ **After:** `"Hi"`

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **`outlet` Function (Output Post-Processing)**

The `outlet` function is like a **proofreader**: tidy up the AI's response (or make final changes) *after it‚Äôs processed by the LLM.*  

üì§ **Input**:
- **`body`**: This contains **all current messages** in the chat (user history + LLM replies).

üöÄ **Your Task**: Modify this `body`. You can clean, append, or log changes, but be mindful of how each adjustment impacts the user experience.

üí° **Best Practices**:
- Prefer logging over direct edits in the outlet (e.g., for debugging or analytics).
- If heavy modifications are needed (like formatting outputs), consider using the **pipe function** instead.

üí° **Example Use Case**: Strip out sensitive API responses you don't want the user to see:
```python
def outlet(self, body: dict, __user__: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict:
    for message in body["messages"]:
        message["content"] = message["content"].replace("<API_KEY>", "[REDACTED]")
    return body 
```

## üåü Filters in Action: Building Practical Examples

Let‚Äôs build some real-world examples to see how you‚Äôd use Filters!

### üìö Example #1: Add Context to Every User Input

Want the LLM to always know it's assisting a customer in troubleshooting software bugs? You can add instructions like **"You're a software troubleshooting assistant"** to every user query.

```python
class Filter:
    def inlet(self, body: dict, __user__: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict:
        context_message = {
            "role": "system", 
            "content": "You're a software troubleshooting assistant."
        }
        body.setdefault("messages", []).insert(0, context_message)
        return body
```

---

### üìö Example #2: Highlight Outputs for Easy Reading

Returning output in Markdown or another formatted style? Use the `outlet` function!

```python
class Filter:
    def outlet(self, body: dict, __user__: Optional[dict] = None) -> dict:
        # Add "highlight" markdown for every response
        for message in body["messages"]:
            if message["role"] == "assistant":  # Target model response
                message["content"] = f"**{message['content']}**"  # Highlight with Markdown
        return body
```

## üöß Potential Confusion: Clear FAQ üõë  

### **Q: How Are Filters Different From Pipe Functions?**

Filters modify data **going to** and **coming from models** but do not significantly interact with logic outside of these phases. Pipes, on the other hand:
- Can integrate **external APIs** or significantly transform how the backend handles operations.
- Expose custom logic as entirely new "models."

### **Q: Can I Do Heavy Post-Processing Inside `outlet`?**

You can, but **it‚Äôs not the best practice.**:
- **Filters** are designed to make lightweight changes or apply logging.
- If heavy modifications are required, consider a **Pipe Function** instead.

---

## üéâ Recap: Why Build Filter Functions?

By now, you‚Äôve learned:
1. **Inlet** manipulates **user inputs** (pre-processing).
2. **Stream** intercepts and modifies **streamed model outputs** (real-time).
3. **Outlet** tweaks **AI outputs** (post-processing).
4. Filters are best for lightweight, real-time alterations to the data flow.
5. With **Valves**, you empower users to configure Filters dynamically for tailored behavior.

üöÄ **Your Turn**: Start experimenting! What small tweak or context addition could elevate your Open WebUI experience? Filters are fun to build, flexible to use, and can take your models to the next level!  

Happy coding! ‚ú®
