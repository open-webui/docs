## Key Features of Open WebUI ⭐

- 🚀 **Effortless Setup**: Install seamlessly using Docker or Kubernetes (`kubectl`, `kustomize` or `helm`) for a hassle-free experience with support for both `:ollama` image with bundled Ollama and `:cuda` with CUDA support.

- 🤝 **OpenAI API Integration**: Effortlessly integrate OpenAI-compatible APIs for versatile conversations alongside Ollama models. The OpenAI API URL can be customized to link with various third-party applications.

- 🛡️ **Granular Permissions and User Groups**: By allowing administrators to create detailed user roles and permissions, we ensure a secure user environment. This granularity not only enhances security but also allows for customized user experiences, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility amongst users.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across desktop PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.

- 📱 **Progressive Web App for Mobile**: Enjoy a native progressive web application experience on your mobile device with offline access on `localhost` or a personal domain, and a smooth user interface. In order for our PWA to be installable on your device, it must be delivered in a secure context. This usually means that it must be served over HTTPS.
  - To set up a PWA, you'll need some understanding of technologies like Linux, Docker, and reverse proxies such as `Nginx`, `Caddy`, or `Traefik`. Using these tools can help streamline the process of building and deploying a PWA tailored to your needs. While there's no "one-click install" option available, and your available option to securely deploy your Open WebUI instance over HTTPS requires user experience, using these resources can make it easier to create and deploy a PWA tailored to your needs.

- ✒️🔢 **Full Markdown and LaTeX Support**: Elevate your LLM experience with comprehensive Markdown and LaTeX capabilities for enriched interaction.

- ⚙️ **Concurrent Model Utilization**: Effortlessly engage with multiple models simultaneously, harnessing their unique strengths for optimal responses. Leverage a diverse set of model modalities in parallel to enhance your experience.

- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensure secure access with restricted permissions. Only authorized individuals can access your Ollama, while model creation and pulling rights are exclusively reserved for administrators.

- 🌐🌍 **Multilingual Support**: Experience Open WebUI in your preferred language with our internationalization (`i18n`) support. We invite you to join us in expanding our supported languages! We're actively seeking contributors!

- 🌟 **Continuous Updates**: We are committed to improving Open WebUI with regular updates, fixes, and new features.
