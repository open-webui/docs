## Key Features of Open WebUI ⭐

- 🚀 **Effortless Setup**: Install seamlessly using Docker, Kubernetes, Podman, Helm Charts (`kubectl`, `kustomize`, `podman`, or `helm`) for a hassle-free experience with support for both `:ollama` image with bundled Ollama and `:cuda` with CUDA support.

- 🛠️ **Guided Initial Setup**: Complete the setup process with clarity, including an explicit indication of creating an admin account during the first-time setup.

- 🤝 **OpenAI API Integration**: Effortlessly integrate OpenAI-compatible APIs for versatile conversations alongside Ollama models. The OpenAI API URL can be customized to integrate Open WebUI seamlessly with various third-party applications.

- 🛡️ **Granular Permissions and User Groups**: By allowing administrators to create detailed user roles, user groups, and permissions across the workspace, we ensure a secure user environment for all users involved. This granularity not only enhances security, but also allows for customized user experiences, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility amongst users.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across desktop PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.

- 📱 **Progressive Web App for Mobile**: Enjoy a native progressive web application experience on your mobile device with offline access on `localhost` or a personal domain, and a smooth user interface. In order for our PWA to be installable on your device, it must be delivered in a secure context. This usually means that it must be served over HTTPS.

  :::info

  - To set up a PWA, you'll need some understanding of technologies like Linux, Docker, and reverse proxies such as `Nginx`, `Caddy`, or `Traefik`. Using these tools can help streamline the process of building and deploying a PWA tailored to your needs. While there's no "one-click install" option available, and your available option to securely deploy your Open WebUI instance over HTTPS requires user experience, using these resources can make it easier to create and deploy a PWA tailored to your needs.
