## Key Features of Open WebUI ⭐

- 🚀 **Effortless Setup**: Install seamlessly using Docker, Kubernetes, Podman, Helm Charts (`kubectl`, `kustomize`, `podman`, or `helm`) for a hassle-free experience with support for both `:ollama` image with bundled Ollama and `:cuda` with CUDA support.

- 🛠️ **Guided Initial Setup**: Complete the setup process with clarity, including an explicit indication of creating an admin account during the first-time setup.

- 🤝 **OpenAI API Integration**: Effortlessly integrate OpenAI-compatible APIs for versatile conversations alongside Ollama models. The OpenAI API URL can be customized to integrate Open WebUI seamlessly with various third-party applications.

- 🛡️ **Granular Permissions and User Groups**: By allowing administrators to create detailed user roles, user groups, and permissions across the workspace, we ensure a secure user environment for all users involved. This granularity not only enhances security, but also allows for customized user experiences, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility amongst users.

- 🔐 **SCIM 2.0 Provisioning**: Enterprise-grade user and group provisioning through SCIM 2.0 protocol, enabling seamless integration with identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace for automated user lifecycle management.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across desktop PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.

- 📱 **Progressive Web App for Mobile**: Enjoy a native progressive web application experience on your mobile device with offline access on `localhost` or a personal domain, and a smooth user interface. In order for our PWA to be installable on your device, it must be delivered in a secure context. This usually means that it must be served over HTTPS.

  :::info

  - To set up a PWA, you'll need some understanding of technologies like Linux, Docker, and reverse proxies such as `Nginx`, `Caddy`, or `Traefik`. Using these tools can help streamline the process of building and deploying a PWA tailored to your needs. While there's no "one-click install" option available, and your available option to securely deploy your Open WebUI instance over HTTPS requires user experience, using these resources can make it easier to create and deploy a PWA tailored to your needs.

### 👑 Administration

- 👑 **Super Admin Assignment**: Automatically assigns the first sign-up as a super admin with an unchangeable role that cannot be modified by anyone else, not even other admins.

- 🛡️ **Granular User Permissions**: Restrict user actions and access with customizable role-based permissions, ensuring that only authorized individuals can perform specific tasks.

- 👥 **Multi-User Management**: Intuitive admin panel with pagination allows you to seamlessly manage multiple users, streamlining user administration and simplifying user life-cycle management.

- 🔧 **Admin Panel**: The user management system is designed to streamline the on-boarding and management of users, offering the option to add users directly or in bulk via CSV import.

- 👥 **Active Users Indicator**: Monitor the number of active users and which models are being utilized by whom to assist in gauging when performance may be impacted due to a high number of users.

- 🔒 **Default Sign-Up Role**: Specify the default role for new sign-ups to `pending`, `user`, or `admin`, providing flexibility in managing user permissions and access levels for new users.

- 🔒 **Prevent New Sign-Ups**: Enable the option to disable new user sign-ups, restricting access to the platform and maintaining a fixed number of users.

- 🔒 **Prevent Chat Deletion**: Ability for admins to toggle a setting that prevents all users from deleting their chat messages, ensuring that all chat messages are retained for audit or compliance purposes.

- 🔗 **Webhook Integration**: Subscribe to new user sign-up events via webhook (compatible with `Discord`, `Google Chat`, `Slack` and `Microsoft Teams`), providing real-time notifications and automation capabilities.

- 📣 **Configurable Notification Banners**: Admins can create customizable banners with persistence in config.json, featuring options for content, background color (`info`, `warning`, `error`, or `success`), and dismissibility. Banners are accessible only to logged-in users, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information.

- 🛡️ **Model Whitelisting**: Enhance security and access control by allowing admins to whitelist models for users with the `user` role, ensuring that only authorized models can be accessed.

- 🔑 **Admin Control for Community Sharing**: Admins can enable or disable community sharing for all users via a toggle in the `Admin Panel` > `Settings` menu. This toggle allows admins to manage accessibility and privacy, ensuring a secure environment. Admins have the option of enabling or disabling the `Share on Community` button for all users, which allows them to control community engagement and collaboration.

- 📧 **Trusted Email Authentication**: Optionally authenticate using a trusted email header, adding an extra layer of security and authentication to protect your Open WebUI instance.

- 🔒 **Backend Reverse Proxy Support**: Bolster security through direct communication between Open WebUI's backend and Ollama. This key feature eliminates the need to expose Ollama over the local area network (LAN). Requests made to the `/ollama/api` route from Open WebUI are seamlessly redirected to Ollama from the backend, enhancing overall system security and providing an additional layer of protection.

- 🔒 **Authentication**: Please note that Open WebUI does not natively support federated authentication schemes such as SSO, OAuth, SAML, or OIDC. However, it can be configured to delegate authentication to an authenticating reverse proxy, effectively achieving a Single Sign-On (`SSO`) experience. This setup allows you to centralize user authentication and management, enhancing security and user convenience. By integrating Open WebUI with an authenticating reverse proxy, you can leverage existing authentication systems and streamline user access to Open WebUI. For more information on configuring this feature, please refer to the [Federated Authentication Support](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/auth).

- 🔓 **Optional Authentication**: Enjoy the flexibility of disabling authentication by setting `WEBUI_AUTH` to `False`. This is an ideal solution for fresh installations without existing users or can be useful for demonstration purposes.

- 🚫 **Advanced API Security**: Block API users based on customized model filters, enhancing security and control over API access.

- ❗ **Administrator Updates**: Ensure administrators stay informed with immediate update notifications upon login, keeping them up-to-date on the latest changes and system statuses.

- 👥 **User Group Management**: Create and manage user groups for seamless organization and control.

- 🔐 **Group-Based Access Control**: Set granular access to models, knowledge, prompts, and tools based on user groups, allowing for more controlled and secure environments.

- 🛠️ **Granular User Permissions**: Easily manage workspace permissions, including file uploads, deletions, edits, and temporary chats, as well as model, knowledge, prompt, and tool creation.

- 🔑 **LDAP Authentication**: Enhance security and scalability with LDAP support for user management.

- 🔐 **SCIM 2.0 Provisioning**: Automate user and group lifecycle management through SCIM 2.0 protocol integration with identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring synchronized user management across systems.

- 🌐 **Customizable OpenAI Connections**: Enjoy smooth operation with custom OpenAI setups, including prefix ID support and explicit model ID support for APIs.
