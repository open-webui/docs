title: "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)"
---

Open WebUI implements a flexible and secure **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system. This system allows administrators to precisely manage user capabilities and access to resources through three interconnected layers:

1.  [**Roles**](./roles.md): The high-level user type (Admin, User, Pending). This defines the baseline trust level.
2.  [**Permissions**](./permissions.md): Granular feature flags (e.g., "Can Delete Chats", "Can Use Web Search").
3.  [**Groups**](./groups.md): The mechanism for organizing users, granting additional permissions, and managing shared access to resources (ACLs). Resources can also be shared directly to individual users.

:::info Key Concept: Additive Permissions
The security model is **Additive**. Users start with their default rights, and Group memberships **add** capabilities. A user effectively has the *union* of all rights granted by their Roles and Groups.
