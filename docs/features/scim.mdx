# SCIM 2.0 Support

Open WebUI supports SCIM 2.0 (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) for automated user and group provisioning from identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace.

## Overview

SCIM is an open standard that allows for the automation of user provisioning. When enabled, your identity provider can automatically:
- Create users in Open WebUI when they're added to your organization
- Update user information when changes are made
- Deactivate users when they're removed from your organization
- Manage group memberships

## Configuration

SCIM is configured entirely through environment variables. There is no UI configuration for SCIM settings.

### Environment Variables

Configure SCIM by setting these environment variables:

- **`SCIM_ENABLED`**: Set to `true` to enable SCIM support (default: `false`)
- **`SCIM_TOKEN`**: The bearer token for SCIM authentication (required when SCIM is enabled)

:::warning

Security Note
The SCIM token should be a secure, randomly generated string. You can generate one using:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
Keep this token secure as it provides access to user management operations.

:::

### Example Configuration

```bash

# Enable SCIM
export SCIM_ENABLED=true

# Set a secure token (replace with your own generated token)
export SCIM_TOKEN="your-secure-token-here"
```

## SCIM API Configuration

When configuring your identity provider, use the following settings:

- **SCIM Base URL**: `<your-openwebui-url>/api/v1/scim/v2/`
- **Authentication**: Bearer Token
- **Token**: `Bearer <your-scim-token>`

### Example for Popular Identity Providers

#### Okta
1. In Okta, add the SCIM application
2. Set the SCIM connector base URL to: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/scim/v2/`
3. Set authentication to "HTTP Header"
4. Add Authorization header with value: `Bearer your-scim-token`


## Supported SCIM Operations

Open WebUI's SCIM implementation supports the following operations:

### User Operations
- **Create User** (`POST /Users`): Create a new user account
- **Get User** (`GET /Users/{id}`): Retrieve user information
- **Update User** (`PUT /Users/{id}`, `PATCH /Users/{id}`): Update user attributes
- **Delete User** (`DELETE /Users/{id}`): Deactivate a user account
- **List Users** (`GET /Users`): List all users with filtering support

### Group Operations
- **Create Group** (`POST /Groups`): Create a new group
- **Get Group** (`GET /Groups/{id}`): Retrieve group information
- **Update Group** (`PUT /Groups/{id}`, `PATCH /Groups/{id}`): Update group membership
- **Delete Group** (`DELETE /Groups/{id}`): Remove a group
- **List Groups** (`GET /Groups`): List all groups with filtering support

### Supported Attributes

#### User Attributes
- `userName`: The user's email address (required, unique)
- `name.givenName`: First name
- `name.familyName`: Last name
- `emails`: Email addresses
- `active`: User status (active/inactive)
- `externalId`: External identifier from the identity provider

#### Group Attributes
- `displayName`: Group name (required)
- `members`: Array of user members
- `externalId`: External identifier from the identity provider

## Filtering Support

The SCIM API supports filtering for both users and groups:

```
GET /api/v1/scim/v2/Users?filter=userName eq "user@example.com"
GET /api/v1/scim/v2/Groups?filter=displayName eq "Engineering"
```

Supported filter operators:
- `eq`: Equals
- `ne`: Not equals
- `co`: Contains
- `sw`: Starts with
- `ew`: Ends with
- `pr`: Present (has value)
- `gt`: Greater than
- `ge`: Greater than or equal
- `lt`: Less than
- `le`: Less than or equal

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **401 Unauthorized Errors**
   - Verify that `SCIM_ENABLED` is set to `true`
   - Check that the bearer token in your identity provider matches `SCIM_TOKEN`
   - Ensure the Authorization header format is: `Bearer <token>`

2. **404 Not Found Errors**
   - Verify the SCIM base URL ends with `/api/v1/scim/v2/`
   - Check that the path includes the `/api/v1` prefix

3. **User Creation Failures**
   - Ensure the `userName` field contains a valid email address
   - Check that the email is not already in use

### Testing SCIM Endpoints

You can test SCIM endpoints using curl:

```bash

# Test authentication and list users
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-scim-token" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/v1/scim/v2/Users

# Get a specific user
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-scim-token" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/v1/scim/v2/Users/user-id

# Create a test user
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-scim-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/scim+json" \
  -d '{
    "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
    "userName": "test@example.com",
    "name": {
      "givenName": "Test",
      "familyName": "User"
    },
    "emails": [{
      "value": "test@example.com",
      "primary": true
    }],
    "active": true
  }' \
  https://your-domain.com/api/v1/scim/v2/Users
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production to protect the bearer token
2. **Secure Token Storage**: Store the SCIM token securely and rotate it periodically
3. **IP Allowlisting**: Consider restricting SCIM API access to your identity provider's IP addresses
4. **Audit Logging**: SCIM operations are logged for security auditing

## Limitations

- Custom schema extensions are not currently supported
- Bulk operations are not implemented
- ETags for resource versioning are not supported

## Integration with SSO

SCIM works best when combined with SSO (Single Sign-On). A typical setup includes:
1. SCIM for automated user provisioning
2. OIDC for user authentication

This ensures users are automatically created and can immediately authenticate using their corporate credentials.

For SSO configuration, see the [SSO documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/sso/).
