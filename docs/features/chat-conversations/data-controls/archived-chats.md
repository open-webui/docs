## FAQ

**Q: Is there a limit to how many chats I can archive?**  
**A:** There is no hard limit. The scalability depends on your database configuration.

**Q: Do archived chats still use storage?**  
**A:** Yes. Archived chats remain in your database. To free up space, you must permanently delete them.
