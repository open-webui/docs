# Message Queue

The **Message Queue** feature allows you to continue composing and sending messages while the AI is still generating a response. Instead of blocking your input until the current response completes, your messages are queued and automatically sent in sequence.

---

## How It Works

When you send a message while the AI is generating a response:

1. **Your message is queued** - It appears in a compact queue area just above the input box
2. **You can continue working** - Add more messages, edit queued messages, or delete them
3. **Automatic processing** - Once the current response finishes, all queued messages are combined and sent together

This creates a seamless workflow where you can capture thoughts as they come without waiting for the AI to finish.

## Queue Management

Each queued message shows three action buttons:

| Action | Icon | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Send Now** | ↑ | Interrupts the current generation and sends this message immediately |
| **Edit** | ✏️ | Removes the message from the queue and puts it back in the input field |
| **Delete** | 🗑️ | Removes the message from the queue without sending |

### Combining Messages

When the AI finishes generating, all queued messages are **combined into a single prompt** (separated by blank lines) and sent together. This means:

- Multiple quick thoughts become one coherent message
- Context flows naturally between your queued inputs
- The AI receives everything at once for better understanding

---

## Persistence

The message queue is preserved when you navigate between chats within the same browser session:

- **Leaving a chat** - Queue is saved to session storage
- **Returning to the chat** - Queue is restored and processed
- **Closing the browser** - Queue is cleared (session storage only)

This means you can start a thought, switch to another chat to check something, and return to find your queued messages waiting.

---

## Settings

You can disable the Message Queue feature if you prefer the traditional behavior:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Interface**
2. Find **Enable Message Queue** under the Chat section
3. Toggle it off

When disabled, sending a message while the AI is generating will:
- **Interrupt** the current generation
- **Send** your new message immediately

:::tip Default Behavior
Message Queue is **enabled by default**. The toggle allows you to choose between:
- **Queue mode** (default) - Messages queue up until generation completes
- **Interrupt mode** - New messages stop current generation immediately
:::

## Use Cases

### 1. Stream of Consciousness

You're reading an AI response and have follow-up questions. Instead of waiting:
- Queue your first follow-up
- Queue a clarification
- Queue another thought

All are sent together when the AI finishes.

### 2. Adding Context

The AI is working on a complex response, but you remember additional context:
- Queue the extra information
- The AI receives it as part of the next message

### 3. Multitasking

You're in a long conversation and need to capture quick notes:
- Queue messages as reminders
- Edit or delete before they're sent
- Use "Send Now" for urgent interruptions

## Summary

| Feature | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Enabled** | Messages queue during generation, sent together when complete |
| **Disabled** | New messages interrupt current generation immediately |
| **Persistence** | Queue survives navigation within session |
| **Actions** | Send Now, Edit, Delete for each queued item |

The Message Queue helps you maintain your flow of thought without the friction of waiting for AI responses to complete.
