# History & Search

Open WebUI provides a powerful system for managing and navigating your previous conversations. Whether you are looking for a specific snippet of code from last month or trying to organize hundreds of chats, the history and search features ensure your data is always accessible.

## Chat History Sidebar

All your conversations are automatically saved in the **Sidebar**.

*   **Persistence**: Chats are saved to the internal database (`webui.db`) and are available across all your devices.
*   **Organization**: Chats are grouped by time period (Today, Yesterday, Previous 7 Days, etc.).
*   **Renaming**: Titles are automatically generated by a task model, but you can manually rename any chat by clicking the pencil icon next to its title.
*   **Archivial**: Instead of deleting, you can **Archive** chats to remove them from the main list while keeping them downloadable and searchable.

## Searching Your History

You can search through your conversations using the global search bar in the sidebar.

1.  Click the **Search** icon or use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`.
2.  Type your query. Open WebUI performs a fuzzy search across:
    *   **Chat Titles**
    *   **Message Content**
    *   **Tags** (Search using `tag:my-tag-name`)
3.  Click on a result to immediately jump to that conversation.

## Native Conversation Search (Agentic)

When using a model with **Native Function Calling** enabled (see the [**Central Tool Calling Guide**](/features/extensibility/plugin/tools#tool-calling-modes-default-vs-native)), models can search through your chat history autonomously.

### Available History Tools:
- **`search_chats`**: Simple text search across chat titles and message content. Returns matching chat IDs and snippets.
- **`view_chat`**: Reads and returns the full message history of a specific chat by ID.

### Why use native tool calling for Search?
This allows the model to leverage its own previous work. You can ask: *"What was the feedback I got on my last email draft?"* or *"Find the Python script I wrote about image processing two weeks ago."*

The model will search your history, identify the correct chat, read it, and provide you with an answer or the code you were looking for—saving you the effort of manual scrolling and copy-pasting.

## Data Management

*   **Export**: You can download individual chats or your entire history as **JSON**, **PDF**, or **Markdown**.
*   **Import**: Drag and drop a JSON chat export into the sidebar to restore it.
*   **Deletion**: You can delete individual chats or clear your entire history from **Settings > Chats**.
