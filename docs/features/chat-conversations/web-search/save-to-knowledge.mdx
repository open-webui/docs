# Save Search Results to Knowledge 📚

The **Add Web Sources to Knowledge Action** allows you to save web search result URLs directly to your Knowledge Base with a single click. This feature streamlines the process of building a research bank by automating the fetching, sanitizing, and uploading of web content.

## Features

- **One-Click Saving**: Quickly add selected sources from a chat message to any Knowledge Base.
- **URL Selection**: Choose specific URLs to save from a numbered list.
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple URLs in a single action.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatically skip URLs that already exist in the target Knowledge Base.
- **Configurable Defaults**: Set a default Knowledge Base and skip confirmation dialogs for a faster workflow.

## Setup

The "Add Web Sources to Knowledge" feature is implemented as a **Function Action**. To use it:

1.  **Download the Action**: Visit the Open WebUI Community Hub and download the [Add Web Sources to Knowledge Action](https://openwebui.com/posts/65d97417-d079-4720-b2cc-a63dd59b7e3e).
2.  **Enable the Action**: 
    *   Navigate to **Workspace > Functions**.
    *   Import or create a new function with the provided code.
    *   Enable the action globally or for specific models.

## How to Use

1.  **Trigger Web Search**: Ask a question that triggers web search (e.g., using DDGS, Google PSE, etc.).
2.  **Click the Action Button**: Once the model returns citations, click the **folder+** icon in the message toolbar.
3.  **Select Sources**: A dialog will appear. Enter the numbers of the sources you wish to save (e.g., `1,3,5` or `1-3` or `all`).
4.  **Choose Knowledge Base**: Select the target Knowledge Base where the content should be saved.
5.  **Done**: The system will fetch the content using your configured **Web Loader** and add it to the Knowledge Base.

## Configuration (Valves)

You can customize the action's behavior through **Valves** in the function settings.

### Admin Settings (Global Defaults)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `max_urls_per_action` | `10` | Maximum number of URLs to process in a single action. |
| `enable_duplicate_check` | `True` | Check if URL already exists in the Knowledge Base before adding. |
| `default_knowledge_base` | `""` | System-wide default Knowledge Base name or ID. |
| `skip_confirmation` | `False` | Skip confirmation dialogs and use the default Knowledge Base. |
| `file_name_prefix` | `""` | Prefix for generated file names (e.g., `web_`). |

### User Settings (Personal Overrides)

Users can override global defaults in their own settings:
- **Default Knowledge Base**: Set a preferred KB to avoid manual selection.
- **Skip Confirmation**: Enable for instant one-click saving (requires a default KB).
- **File Name Prefix**: Customize the prefix for your saved sources.

## Troubleshooting

- **Content Quality**: The quality of the saved content depends on your **Web Loader Engine** settings (Admin > Settings > Documents). For JavaScript-heavy sites, consider using **Firecrawl** or **Playwright**.
- **No URLs Found**: This action works with web search results that return structured citations. If no URLs are detected, ensure web search is properly enabled and returning results.
