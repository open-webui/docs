## OAuth Configuration Overview

| Environment Variable                  | Default   | Description                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `WEBUI_URL`                           | —                  | **Required.** Your public WebUI address, e.g., `http://localhost:8080`. |
| `ENABLE_OAUTH_PERSISTENT_CONFIG`      | `true`             | Persist OAuth config to the database; set to `false` for stateless/containerized environments. |
| `ENABLE_OAUTH_SIGNUP`                 | `false`            | Allows account creation upon OAuth login (separate from `ENABLE_SIGNUP`). |
| `OAUTH_MERGE_ACCOUNTS_BY_EMAIL`       | `false`            | Merge OAuth logins based on matching email (caution: can be insecure if provider doesn't verify emails). |
| `OAUTH_UPDATE_PICTURE_ON_LOGIN`       | `true`             | Update user profile pictures from OAuth provider with each login. |
| `OAUTH_PICTURE_CLAIM`                 | `picture`          | Field in the claim containing the profile picture. Set to empty string to disable picture updates (users receive default icon).|
| `WEBUI_AUTH_SIGNOUT_REDIRECT_URL`     | *empty*            | Redirect users to this URL after signout. E.g., `https://your-company.com/logout-success`                                      |
| `WEBUI_SECRET_KEY`                    | *empty*            | MUST be set - especially in clustered environments. Otherwise session issues and weird OAuth issues will occur                 |
| `OAUTH_SESSION_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`  | `WEBUI_SECRET_KEY` | A secret key for encrypting OAuth tokens stored on the server. Must be shared across all instances in a cluster. |
| `OAUTH_CLIENT_INFO_ENCRYPTION_KEY`    | `WEBUI_SECRET_KEY` | A secret key for encrypting OAuth client information stored on the server - used for OAuth 2.1 authentication for MCP servers. |
| `ENABLE_OAUTH_ID_TOKEN_COOKIE`        | `true`             | For backward compatibility. Controls if the legacy `oauth_id_token` cookie is set. Recommended to set to `false`. |

:::warning

**Critical Configuration Notes:**

1. **WEBUI_URL Must Be Set First**: Configure `WEBUI_URL` in the Admin Panel before enabling OAuth, as it's used for redirect URIs.

2. **Persistent Config Behavior**: When `ENABLE_OAUTH_PERSISTENT_CONFIG=true` (default), OAuth settings are stored in the database after first launch. To change environment variables after initial setup, either:
   - Set `ENABLE_OAUTH_PERSISTENT_CONFIG=false` to always read from environment variables
   - Update settings through the Admin Panel instead of environment variables

3. **Required Variables**: Always verify you're using the exact variable names from the [environment configuration documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/env-configuration/). Common mistakes include using non-existent variables like `OIDC_CONFIG`.

### Server-Side OAuth Session Management

To solve issues related to large tokens (e.g., with AD FS group claims exceeding cookie size limits) and to enable automatic token refreshing, Open WebUI now supports a robust server-side session management system.

**How It Works:**

1. **Server-Side Storage:** Instead of storing large `access_token` and `id_token` values in browser cookies, the entire token payload is now encrypted and stored securely in the Open WebUI database in a new `oauth_session` table.
2. **Secure Session Cookie:** The user's browser is sent a single, small, and secure `httponly` cookie named `oauth_session_id`. This cookie acts as an opaque identifier, containing no sensitive information itself.
3. **Automatic Refresh:** When a token is required by a downstream service (like a tool or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint), the backend uses the `oauth_session_id` to retrieve the tokens. If the tokens are expired or close to expiring, the system automatically uses the stored `refresh_token` to fetch new ones from the provider before forwarding them. This ensures services always receive a valid token and prevents silent failures.
4. **Clean Token Access:** This architecture provides a clean and reliable way for internal tools and other services to access user tokens without fragile cookie-scraping.

This system is enabled by default but can be fine-tuned with the environment variables detailed above.

For more information, check out the [environment variable docs page](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/env-configuration/).

### Google

To configure a Google OAuth client, please refer to [Google's documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) on how to create a Google OAuth client for a **web application**.
The allowed redirect URI should include `<open-webui>/oauth/google/callback`.

The following environment variables are required:

1. `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
1. `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret
1. `OPENID_PROVIDER_URL` - Must be set for logout to work properly. (Usually to `https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`)

### Microsoft

To configure a Microsoft OAuth client, please refer to [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) on how to create a Microsoft OAuth client for a **web application**.
The allowed redirect URI should include `<open-webui>/oauth/microsoft/callback`. This value should be used for the `MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable.

Support for Microsoft OAuth is currently limited to a single tenant, that is a single Entra organization or personal Microsoft accounts.

The following environment variables are required:

1. `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` - Microsoft OAuth client ID
1. `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` - Microsoft OAuth client secret
1. `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_TENANT_ID` - Microsoft tenant ID - use `9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad` for personal accounts
1. `MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI` - The redirect URI configured in your Microsoft OAuth application. This must be set to `<open-webui>/oauth/microsoft/callback`.
1. `OPENID_PROVIDER_URL` - Must be set for logout to work properly.

### Github

To configure a Github OAuth Client, please refer to [Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) on how to create a OAuth App or Github App for a **web application**.
The allowed redirect URI should include `<open-webui>/oauth/github/callback`.

The following environment variables are required:

1. `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` - Github OAuth App Client ID
1. `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` - Github OAuth App Client Secret

### OIDC

Any authentication provider that supports OIDC can be configured.
The `email` claim is required.
`name` and `picture` claims are used if available.
The allowed redirect URI should include `<open-webui>/oauth/oidc/callback`.

The following environment variables are used:

1. `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - OIDC client ID
1. `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - OIDC client secret
1. `OPENID_PROVIDER_URL` - **Required.** OIDC well known URL, for example `https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`
1. `OAUTH_PROVIDER_NAME` - Name of the provider to show on the UI, defaults to SSO
1. `OAUTH_SCOPES` - Scopes to request. Defaults to `openid email profile`
1. `OPENID_REDIRECT_URI` - The redirect URI configured in your OIDC application. This must be set to `<open-webui>/oauth/oidc/callback`.

:::warning

**Common OIDC Mistakes:**
- Using non-existent environment variables like `OIDC_CONFIG` or `WEBUI_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`
- Forgetting to set `OPENID_PROVIDER_URL` (this is mandatory for OIDC)
- Using incorrect redirect URI format - must be exactly `<your-domain>/oauth/oidc/callback`

:::

### OAuth Role Management

Any OAuth provider that can be configured to return roles in the access token can be used to manage roles in Open WebUI.
To use this feature set `ENABLE_OAUTH_ROLE_MANAGEMENT` to `true`.
You can configure the following environment variables to match the roles returned by the OAuth provider:

1. `OAUTH_ROLES_CLAIM` - The claim that contains the roles. Defaults to `roles`. Can also be nested, for example `user.roles`.
1. `OAUTH_ALLOWED_ROLES` - A comma-separated list of roles that are allowed to log in (receive open webui role `user`).
1. `OAUTH_ADMIN_ROLES` - A comma-separated list of roles that are allowed to log in as an admin (receive open webui role `admin`).
1. `OAUTH_ROLES_SEPARATOR` - Allows specifying an alternative sparator for the `OAUTH_*_ROLES` variables.

:::info

If changing the role of a logged in user, they will need to log out and log back in to receive the new role.

:::

### OAuth Group Management

Any OAuth provider that can be configured to return groups in the access token can be used to manage user groups in Open WebUI upon user login.
To enable this synchronization, set `ENABLE_OAUTH_GROUP_MANAGEMENT` to `true`.

You can configure the following environment variables:

1. `OAUTH_GROUP_CLAIM` - The claim in the ID/access token containing the user's group memberships. Defaults to `groups`. Can also be nested, for example `user.memberOf`. Required if `ENABLE_OAUTH_GROUP_MANAGEMENT` is true.
1. `ENABLE_OAUTH_GROUP_CREATION` - If `true` (and `ENABLE_OAUTH_GROUP_MANAGEMENT` is also `true`), Open WebUI will perform **Just-in-Time (JIT) group creation**. This means it will automatically create groups during OAuth login if they are present in the user's OAuth claims but do not yet exist in the system. Defaults to `false`. If `false`, only memberships in *existing* Open WebUI groups will be managed.

:::warning

Strict Group Synchronization
When `ENABLE_OAUTH_GROUP_MANAGEMENT` is set to `true`, a user's group memberships in Open WebUI are **strictly synchronized** with the groups received in their OAuth claims upon each login.

*   Users will be **added** to Open WebUI groups that match their OAuth claims.
*   Users will be **removed** from any Open WebUI groups (including those manually created or assigned within Open WebUI) if those groups are **not** present in their OAuth claims for that login session.

Ensure all necessary groups are correctly configured in your OAuth provider and included in the group claim (`OAUTH_GROUP_CLAIM`).

:::

:::warning

Admin Users
Admin users' group memberships are **not** automatically updated via OAuth group management.

:::

:::info

Login Required for Updates

If a user's groups change in the OAuth provider, they will need to log out of Open WebUI and log back in for the changes to be reflected.

:::

## Trusted Header

Open WebUI is able to delegate authentication to an authenticating reverse proxy that passes in the user's details in HTTP headers.
There are several example configurations that are provided in this page.

:::danger

Incorrect configuration can allow users to authenticate as any user on your Open WebUI instance.
Make sure to allow only the authenticating proxy access to Open WebUI, such as by not opening any direct ports on the container, or by setting `HOST=127.0.0.1` so that it only listens on the loopback interface.

:::

### Generic Configuration

When the `WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_EMAIL_HEADER` environment variable is set, Open WebUI will use the value of the header specified as the email address of the user, handling automatic registration and login.

For example, setting `WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_EMAIL_HEADER=X-User-Email` and passing a HTTP header of `X-User-Email: example@example.com` would authenticate the request with the email `example@example.com`.

Optionally, you can also define the `WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_NAME_HEADER` to determine the name of any user being created using trusted headers. This has no effect if the user already exists.
If `WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_NAME_HEADER` is not set, the email address is used as user name.

#### Group Management

You can use the `WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_GROUPS_HEADER` environment variable to synchronize user groups in Open WebUI. Set this variable to the name of the HTTP header that will contain a comma-separated list of group names for the authenticated user.

When a request is authenticated via `WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_EMAIL_HEADER`, and the trusted groups header is set and present, Open WebUI will update the user's group memberships to match the groups listed in the header.

- The header value must be a comma-separated list of group names (e.g., `X-User-Groups: admins,editors,users`).
- If the header is not present or empty, the user's group memberships will not be updated.
- User will be unassigned from groups not present in the header.
- Group creation via trusted header is not automatic; only existing groups in Open WebUI will be assigned.

### Tailscale Serve

[Tailscale Serve](https://tailscale.com/kb/1242/tailscale-serve) allows you to share a service within your tailnet, and Tailscale will set the header `Tailscale-User-Login` with the email address of the requester.

Below is an example serve config with a corresponding Docker Compose file that starts a Tailscale sidecar, exposing Open WebUI to the tailnet with the tag `open-webui` and hostname `open-webui`, and can be reachable at `https://open-webui.TAILNET_NAME.ts.net`.
You will need to create an OAuth client with device write permission to pass into the Tailscale container as `TS_AUTHKEY`.

```json title="tailscale/serve.json"
{
    "TCP": {
        "443": {
            "HTTPS": true
        }
    },
    "Web": {
        "${TS_CERT_DOMAIN}:443": {
            "Handlers": {
                "/": {
                    "Proxy": "http://open-webui:8080"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
---
services:
  open-webui:
    image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
    volumes:
      - open-webui:/app/backend/data
    environment:
      - WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_EMAIL_HEADER=Tailscale-User-Login
      - WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_NAME_HEADER=Tailscale-User-Name
    restart: unless-stopped
  tailscale:
    image: tailscale/tailscale:latest
    environment:
      - TS_AUTH_ONCE=true
      - TS_AUTHKEY=${TS_AUTHKEY}
      - TS_EXTRA_ARGS=--advertise-tags=tag:open-webui
      - TS_SERVE_CONFIG=/config/serve.json
      - TS_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/tailscale
      - TS_HOSTNAME=open-webui
    volumes:
      - tailscale:/var/lib/tailscale
      - ./tailscale:/config
      - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun
    cap_add:
      - net_admin
      - sys_module
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  open-webui: {}
  tailscale: {}
```

:::warning

If you run Tailscale in the same network context as Open WebUI, then by default users will be able to directly reach out to Open WebUI without going through the Serve proxy.
You will need use Tailscale's ACLs to restrict access to only port 443.

### Cloudflare Tunnel with Cloudflare Access

[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/) can be used with [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) to protect Open WebUI with SSO.
This is barely documented by Cloudflare, but `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email` is set with the email address of the authenticated user.

Below is an example Docker Compose file that sets up a Cloudflare sidecar.
Configuration is done via the dashboard.
From the dashboard, get a tunnel token, set the tunnel backend to `http://open-webui:8080`, and ensure that "Protect with Access" is checked and configured.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
---
services:
  open-webui:
    image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
    volumes:
      - open-webui:/app/backend/data
    environment:
      - WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_EMAIL_HEADER=Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email
    restart: unless-stopped
  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    environment:
      - TUNNEL_TOKEN=${TUNNEL_TOKEN}
    command: tunnel run
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  open-webui: {}

```

### oauth2-proxy

[oauth2-proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/) is an authenticating reverse proxy that implements social OAuth providers and OIDC support.

Given the large number of potential configurations, below is an example of a potential setup with Google OAuth.
Please refer to `oauth2-proxy`'s documentation for detailed setup and any potential security gotchas.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
services:
  open-webui:
    image: ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
    volumes:
      - open-webui:/app/backend/data
    environment:
      - 'WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_EMAIL_HEADER=X-Forwarded-Email'
      - 'WEBUI_AUTH_TRUSTED_NAME_HEADER=X-Forwarded-User'
    restart: unless-stopped
  oauth2-proxy:
    image: quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy:v7.6.0
    environment:
      OAUTH2_PROXY_HTTP_ADDRESS: 0.0.0.0:4180
      OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS: http://open-webui:8080/
      OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER: google
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID: REPLACEME_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
      OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET: REPLACEME_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
      OAUTH2_PROXY_EMAIL_DOMAINS: REPLACEME_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS
      OAUTH2_PROXY_REDIRECT_URL: REPLACEME_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL
      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET: REPLACEME_COOKIE_SECRET
      OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECURE: "false"
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 4180:4180/tcp
```

### Authentik

To configure a [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/) OAuth client, please refer to [documentation](https://integrations.goauthentik.io/miscellaneous/open-webui/) on how to create an application and `OAuth2/OpenID Provider`.
The allowed redirect URI should include `<open-webui>/oauth/oidc/callback`.

While creating provider, please note `App-name`, `Client-ID` and `Client-Secret` and use it for open-webui environment variables:

```
      - 'ENABLE_OAUTH_SIGNUP=true'
      - 'OAUTH_MERGE_ACCOUNTS_BY_EMAIL=true'
      - 'OAUTH_PROVIDER_NAME=Authentik'
      - 'OPENID_PROVIDER_URL=https://<authentik-url>/application/o/<App-name>/.well-known/openid-configuration'
      - 'OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<Client-ID>'
      - 'OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client-Secret>'
      - 'OAUTH_SCOPES=openid email profile'
      - 'OPENID_REDIRECT_URI=https://<open-webui>/oauth/oidc/callback'
```

### Authelia

[Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) can be configured to return a header for use with trusted header authentication.
Documentation is available [here](https://www.authelia.com/integration/trusted-header-sso/introduction/).

No example configs are provided due to the complexity of deploying Authelia.
