# Agentic Web Search & URL Fetching 🌐

Open WebUI's web search has evolved from simple result injection to a fully **agentic research system**. By enabling **Native Function Calling**, you allow the model to independently explore the web, verify facts, and follow links.

## Native Mode vs. Traditional RAG

| Feature | Traditional RAG (Default) | Agentic Search (Native Mode) |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Search Decision** | Open WebUI decides based on prompt analysis. | The **Model** decides if it needs data. |
| **Search Queries** | Usually a single query executed once. | Multiple queries can be run sequentially. |
| **Link Following** | Snippets from top results are injected. | The model can use `fetch_url` to read full pages. |
| **Reasoning** | Model process data *after* injection. | Model can search, read, check, and search again. |

## How to Enable Agentic Behavior

To unlock these features, your model must support native tool calling (e.g., GPT-5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 3 Flash, MiniMax M2.1). Administrator-level configuration for these built-in system tools is handled via the [**Central Tool Calling Guide**](/features/plugin/tools#tool-calling-modes-default-vs-native).

1.  **Enable Web Search**: Ensure a search engine is configured in **Admin Panel > Settings > Web Search**.
2.  **Enable Native Mode**:
    *   Go to **Admin Panel > Settings > Models**.
    *   Navigate to **Model Specific Settings** for your target model.
    *   Under **Advanced Parameters**, set **Function Calling** to `Native`.
3.  **Chat Features**: Ensure the **Web Search** feature is toggled **ON** for your chat session.

## The `fetch_url` Tool 🔗

One of the most powerful additions is the ability for the model to "visit" specific URLs. 

Previously, a model could only see snippets from search results. Now, if it sees a promising link, it can invoke `fetch_url(url="...")` to extract the full text content of that page.

**How it fetches:** The `fetch_url` tool uses the **Web Loader Engine** (e.g., Safe Web, Playwright, or Firecrawl) configured by the administrator in **Admin Panel > Settings > Web Search**. This ensures the model respects your custom proxy, filtering, and timeout settings.

This allows for:
- Summarizing specific news articles.
- Technical documentation research.
- Verifying details that aren't present in search snippets.

## Deep Research & Interleaved Thinking 🧠

Because the model can call `web_search` multiple times, it can perform "Deep Research" using **Interleaved Thinking**. This is a cycle where the model can:

1.  **Think**: Analyze the user prompt.
2.  **Search**: Run a broad `web_search` query.
3.  **Think**: Evaluate the results and identify gaps or new directions.
4.  **Refine**: Call `web_search` again with highly specific technical keywords.
5.  **Think**: Synthesize findings.
6.  **Fetch**: Use `fetch_url` to read a specific deep-dive source.
7.  **Finalize**: Answer the user with grounded, verified information.

This iterative loop of **Thought → Action → Thought** continues until the model has sufficient information to answer your request with maximum accuracy.
