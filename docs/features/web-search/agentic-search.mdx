# Agentic Web Search & URL Fetching 🌐

Open WebUI's web search has evolved from simple result injection to a fully **agentic research system**. By enabling **Native Function Calling**, you allow the model to independently explore the web, verify facts, and follow links.

## Native Mode vs. Traditional RAG

| Feature | Traditional RAG (Default) | Agentic Search (Native Mode) |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Search Decision** | Open WebUI decides based on prompt analysis. | The **Model** decides if and when it needs to search. |
| **Data Processing** | Fetches ALL results, chunks them, and performs **RAG**. | Returns **Snippets** directly; no chunking or Vector DB. |
| **Link Following** | Snippets from top results are injected. | Model uses `fetch_url` to read a **Full Page** directly. |
| **Model Context** | Only gets relevant fragments (Top-K chunks). | Gets the **whole text** (up to ~50k chars) via `fetch_url`. |
| **Reasoning** | Model processes data *after* system injection. | Model can search, read, check, and search again. |

## How to Enable Agentic Behavior

To unlock these features, your model must support native tool calling (e.g., GPT-5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 3 Flash, MiniMax M2.1). Administrator-level configuration for these built-in system tools is handled via the [**Central Tool Calling Guide**](/features/plugin/tools#tool-calling-modes-default-vs-native).

1.  **Enable Web Search**: Ensure a search engine is configured in **Admin Panel > Settings > Web Search**.
2.  **Enable Native Mode**:
    *   Go to **Admin Panel > Settings > Models**.
    *   Navigate to **Model Specific Settings** for your target model.
    *   Under **Advanced Parameters**, set **Function Calling** to `Native`.
3.  **Chat Features**: Ensure the **Web Search** feature is toggled **ON** for your chat session.

## How Native Tools Handle Data
🔗 It is important to understand that Native Mode works fundamentally differently from the global "Web Search" toggle found in standard models.

### `web_search` (Snippets only)
When the model invokes `web_search`:
*   **Action**: It queries your search engine and receives a list of titles, links, and snippets.
*   **No RAG**: Unlike traditional search, **no data is stored in a Vector DB**. No chunking or embedding occurs.
*   **Result**: The model sees exactly what a human sees on a search results page. If the snippet contains the answer, the model responds. If not, the model must decide to "deep dive" into a link.

### `fetch_url` (Full Page Context)
If the model determines that a search snippet is insufficient, it will call `fetch_url`:
*   **Direct Access**: The tool visits the specific URL and extracts the main text using your configured **Web Loader**.
*   **Raw Context**: The extracted text is injected **directly into the model's context window** (hard-coded truncation at exactly 50,000 characters to prevent context overflow).
*   **Agentic Advantage**: Because it doesn't use RAG, the model has the "full picture" of the page rather than isolated fragments. This allows it to follow complex instructions on specific pages (e.g., "Summarize the technical specifications table from this documentation link").

:::tip
By keeping `web_search` and `fetch_url` separate and RAG-free, the model acts as its own **Information Retrieval** agent, choosing exactly which sources are worth reading in full.

## Deep Research & Interleaved Thinking 🧠

Because the model can call `web_search` multiple times, it can perform "Deep Research" using **Interleaved Thinking**. This is a cycle where the model can:

1.  **Think**: Analyze the user prompt.
2.  **Search**: Run a broad `web_search` query.
3.  **Think**: Evaluate the results and identify gaps or new directions.
4.  **Refine**: Call `web_search` again with highly specific technical keywords.
5.  **Think**: Synthesize findings.
6.  **Fetch**: Use `fetch_url` to read a specific deep-dive source.
7.  **Finalize**: Answer the user with grounded, verified information.

This iterative loop of **Thought → Action → Thought** continues until the model has sufficient information to answer your request with maximum accuracy.
