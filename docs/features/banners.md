Overview
--------

Open WebUI provides a feature that allows administrators to create customizable banners with persistence in the `config.json` file. These banners can feature options for content, background color (info, warning, error, or success), and dismissibility. Banners are accessible only to logged-in users, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information.

Configuring Banners through the Admin Panel
---------------------------------------------

To configure banners through the admin panel, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Open WebUI instance as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the `Admin Panel` -> `Settings` -> `Interface`.
3. Locate the `Banners` option directly above the `Default Prompt Suggestions` option.
4. Click on the `+` icon to add a new banner.
5. Select the banner type and set the banner text as desired.
6. Choose whether the banner is dismissible or not.
7. Set the timestamp for the banner (optional).
8. Press `Save` at the bottom of the page to save the banner.

Configuring Banners through Environment Variables
------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can configure banners through environment variables. To do this, you will need to set the `WEBUI_BANNERS` environment variable with a list of dictionaries in the following format:

```json
[{"id": "string","type": "string [info, success, warning, error]","title": "string","content": "string","dismissible": False,"timestamp": 1000}]
```

For more information on configuring environment variables in Open WebUI, see [Environment Variable Configuration](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/advanced-topics/env-configuration#webui_banners).
