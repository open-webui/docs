# 📜 Prompts

Imagine you’ve just started exploring Open WebUI, or maybe you've been using it but find yourself wondering what "Prompts" are about. Is it just tech lingo? Not really! Let's break it down step-by-step so you'll fully understand how they work, what makes them useful, and why using them is easier than it seems.

## TL;DR

- **Prompts** are the instructions you give the AI to get the kind of responses you want.
- **Custom Prompts** allow you to tailor prompts for specific needs, making interactions with the AI smoother and more efficient.

Creating and using prompts and presets is straightforward because Open WebUI already has these capabilities built-in! All you need to do is **click and customize** to enhance your interactions.

## What are "Prompts"?

Think of **Open WebUI** as a smart tool that follows your instructions to respond in useful ways. But sometimes, you want it to understand you better or respond in a specific style. That’s where **prompts** come into play.

### Prompts

**Prompts** are the way you communicate with the AI, instructing it on how to respond. They guide the AI’s responses based on your instructions.

#### Example of a Prompt:

Imagine you’re interacting with the AI and want it to respond in a polite, formal tone, or maybe you need a summary instead of a long answer. A well-crafted prompt can make sure the AI gives you just that.

Some examples of prompt styles you might use:
1. **Polite request** (“Please summarize this article.”)
2. **Creative approach** (“Write a poem about autumn.”)
3. **Concise response** (“Give a one-sentence answer on this topic.”)

By adjusting your prompts, you’re guiding the AI to respond in a way that aligns with your needs.


### How Prompts Work:

Let’s say you frequently ask the AI to check your grammar or summarize articles. With a preset, you don’t have to type out the full prompt every time—just select the preset, and the AI knows exactly what to do!

- **Saved-prompt are like shortcuts** for recurring prompts. Once you set them up, they’re always ready to go with a single click.

Some examples of useful preset categories:
1. **Grammar Check** 📝
2. **Summarizer** 📰
3. **Creative Writing** ✍️

## How to Create Custom Prompts

Creating a custom prompt involves deciding on the specific instructions you want to give the AI. The prompt creation feature in Open WebUI allows you to:
1. Add a title for your prompt (e.g., "Professional Email").
2. Add a command for your prompt that can be use later to autofil the message. 
3. Define the prompt content with customizable placeholders.
4. Save and reuse the prompt as needed.

Admins can add prompts to the workspace, which users can access and use; however, users do not have direct access to the workspace itself.

## Using Community Prompts

Open WebUI offers a [collection of prompts](https://openwebui.com/prompts)contributed by other users. You can browse and download prompts like “Code Expert,” “Grammar Check and Rewrite” or “Image Description Assistant,” to quickly enhance your experience with minimal setup.
