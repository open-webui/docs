# 📜 Prompt Presets

Imagine you’ve just started exploring Open WebUI, or maybe you've been using it but find yourself wondering what "Prompt Prsets" are about. Is it just tech lingo? Not really! Let's break it down step-by-step so you'll fully understand how they work, what makes them useful, and why using them is easier than it seems.

**Prompt Presets** are predefined templates or examples designed to guide or standardize the types of responses generated by AI language models. They provide a quick way to reuse commonly used prompts without having to type them out every time. 

By leveraging prompt presets, you can save time, maintain consistency, and streamline your workflow, whether you're creating structured queries, generating content, or experimenting with the capabilities of Open WebUI. Simply select or customize a preset to get started and enjoy a faster, more convenient experience with your prompts!

## How to Create Custom Prompts

Creating a custom prompt involves deciding on the specific instructions you want to give the AI. The prompt creation feature in Open WebUI allows you to:
1. Add a title for your prompt (e.g., "Professional Email").
2. Add a command for your prompt that can be use later to autofil the message. 
3. Define the prompt content with customizable placeholders.
4. You can save and reuse prompts as needed by using a `/` command.

Admins can add prompts to the workspace, which users can access and use; however, users do not have direct access to the workspace itself.

# Prompt Variables

You can use variables by placing text within `{{ }}`, like `{{YOUR_VARIABLE}}`, which will be highlighted in your prompt for easy identification. These variables act as placeholders, allowing you to create adaptable prompts that can be quickly customized. When using a prompt with these placeholders, you can easily tab between them using the Tab key to move to the next variable and fill it in.

# Reserved Variables Support

If you want to write your own prompt, these are the variables that can help you. Open WebUI provides a range of dynamic prompt variables that allow you to create interactive and context-aware prompts. Below is a chart of the available variables and their descriptions:

| **Reserved Variable**          | **Description**                                                                                  | **Requirements**                                                                 |

| `{{CURRENT_WEEKDAY}}` | Inserts the current day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).                                      | None                                                                             |
| `{{USER_NAME}}`       | Inserts the user's name.                                                                         | None                                                                             |
| `{{USER_LANGUAGE}}`   | Inserts the user's language setting.                                                             | None                                                                             |

Using these variables, you can create personalized prompts or automate workflows that adapt to real-time data. For example, you can generate location-specific responses, use clipboard content for quick context integration, or adapt prompts based on the current time and date. Enable these variables in the settings menu to unlock their full potential!
