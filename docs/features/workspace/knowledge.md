# ðŸ§  Knowledge

 Knowledge part of Open WebUI is like a memory bank that makes your interactions even more powerful and context-aware. Let's break down what "Knowledge" really means in Open WebUI, how it works, and why itâ€™s incredibly helpful for enhancing your experience.

## TL;DR

- **Knowledge** is a section in Open WebUI where you can store structured information that the system can refer to during your interactions.
- Itâ€™s like a memory system for Open WebUI that allows it to pull from saved data, making responses more personalized and contextually aware.
- You can use Knowledge directly in your chats with Open WebUI to access the stored data whenever you need it.

Setting up Knowledge is straightforward! Simply head to the Knowledge section inside work space and start adding details or data. You donâ€™t need coding expertise or technical setup; itâ€™s built into the core system!

## What is the "Knowledge" Section?

The **Knowledge section** is a storage area within Open WebUI where you can save specific pieces of information or data points. Think of it as a **reference library** that Open WebUI can use to make its responses more accurate and relevant to your needs.

### Why is Knowledge Useful?

Imagine you're working on a long-term project and want the system to remember certain parameters, settings, or even key notes about the project without having to remind it every time. Or perhaps, you want it to remember specific personal preferences for chats and responses. The Knowledge section is where you can store this kind of **persistent information** so that Open WebUI can reference it in future conversations, creating a more **coherent, personalized experience**.

Some examples of what you might store in Knowledge:
- Important project parameters or specific data points youâ€™ll frequently reference.
- Custom commands, workflows, or settings you want to apply.
- Personal preferences, guidelines, or rules that Open WebUI can follow in every chat.

### How to Use Knowledge in Chats

Accessing stored Knowledge in your chats is easy! By simply referencing whatâ€™s saved(using '#' before the name), Open WebUI can pull in data or follow specific guidelines that youâ€™ve set up in the Knowledge section. 

For example:
- When discussing a project, Open WebUI can automatically recall your specified project details.
- It can apply custom preferences to responses, like formality levels or preferred phrasing.

To reference Knowledge in your chats, just ensure itâ€™s saved in the Knowledge section, and Open WebUI will know when and where to bring in the relevant information!

Admins can add knowledge to the workspace, which users can access and use; however, users do not have direct access to the workspace itself.

### Setting Up Your Knowledge Base

1. **Navigate to the Knowledge Section**: This area is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive.
2. **Add Entries**: Input information you want Open WebUI to remember. It can be as specific or broad as you like.
3. **Save and Apply**: Once saved, the Knowledge is accessible and ready to enhance your chat interactions.

## Summary

- The Knowledge section is like Open WebUI's "memory bank," where you can store data that you want it to remember and use.
- **Use Knowledge to keep the system aware** of important details, ensuring a personalized chat experience.
- You can **directly reference Knowledge in chats** to bring in stored data whenever you need it using '#' + name of the knowlege.


ðŸŒŸ Remember, thereâ€™s always more to discover, so dive in and make Open WebUI truly your own!
