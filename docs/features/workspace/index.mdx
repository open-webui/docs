The Workspace in Open WebUI provides a comprehensive environment for managing your AI interactions and configurations. It consists of several key components:

## Resources

- [🤖 Models](./models.md) - Create and manage custom models tailored to specific purposes
- [🧠 Knowledge](./knowledge.md) - Manage your knowledge bases for retrieval augmented generation
- [📚 Prompts](./prompts.md) - Create and organize reusable prompts

Each section of the Workspace is designed to give you fine-grained control over your Open WebUI experience, allowing for customization and optimization of your AI interactions.

## Access Control
- [‍🔑 Roles](./roles.md) - The roles defined in Open WebUI
- [‍🔐 Groups](./groups.md) - Setup groups of users to share access to resources
- [🔒 Permissions](./permissions.md) - Configure access controls and feature availability

Roles, groups and permissions are designed to work together to provide a finegrained model for controlling user access to individual resources.
