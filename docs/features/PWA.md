COMING SOON!

ðŸ“± Progressive Web App for Mobile: Enjoy a native progressive web application experience on your mobile device with offline access on localhost or a personal domain, and a smooth user interface. In order for our PWA to be installable on your device, it must be delivered in a secure context. This usually means that it must be served over HTTPS.

    To set up a PWA, you'll need some understanding of technologies like Linux, Docker, and reverse proxies such as Nginx, Caddy, or Traefik. Using these tools can help streamline the process of building and deploying a PWA tailored to your needs. While there's no "one-click install" option available, and your available option to securely deploy your Open WebUI instance over HTTPS requires user experience, using these resources can make it easier to create and deploy a PWA tailored to your needs.
