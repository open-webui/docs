## Access Control
- [‍🔑 Roles](./roles.md) - The roles defined in Open WebUI
- [‍🔐 Groups](./groups.md) - Setup groups of users to share access to resources
- [🔒 Permissions](./permissions.md) - Configure access controls and feature availability

Roles, groups and permissions are designed to work together to provide a finegrained model for controlling user access to individual resources.
