### Enabling Community Sharing

To enable community sharing, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Admin Panel** page as an **Admin**.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. Toggle on **Enable Community Sharing** within the **General** settings tab.

:::note
**Note:** Only Admins can toggle the **Enable Community Sharing** option. If this option is toggled off, users and Admins will not see the **Share to Open WebUI Community** option for sharing their chats. Community sharing must be enabled by an Admin for users to share chats to the Open WebUI community.
:::

This will enable community sharing for all users on your Open WebUI instance.

### Sharing Chats

To share a chat:

1. Select the chat conversation you want to share.
2. Click on the 3-dots that appear when hovering the mouse pointer above the desired chat.
3. Then click on the **Share** option.
4. Select either **Share to Open WebUI Community** (if **Enable Community Sharing** is toggled on by an **Admin**) or **Copy Link**.

#### Sharing to Open WebUI Community

When you select `Share to Open WebUI Community`:

* A new tab will open, allowing you to upload your chat as a snapshot to the Open WebUI community website (https://openwebui.com/chats/upload).
* You can control who can view your uploaded chat by choosing from the following access settings:
  * **Private**: Only you can access this chat.
  * **Public**: Anyone on the internet can view the messages displayed in the chat snapshot.
  * **Public, Full History**: Anyone on the internet can view the full regeneration history of your chat.

:::note
Note: You can change the permission level of your shared chats on the community platform at any time from your openwebui.com account.

**Currently, shared chats on the community website cannot be found through search. However, future updates are planned to allow public chats to be discoverable by the public if their permission is set to `Public` or `Public, Full History`.**

#### Copying a Share Link

When you select `Copy Link`, a unique share link is generated that can be shared with others.

**Important Considerations:**

* The shared chat will only include messages that existed at the time the link was created. Any new messages sent within the chat after the link is generated will not be included, unless the link is deleted and updated with a new link.
* The generated share link acts as a static snapshot of the chat at the time the link was generated.
* To view the shared chat, users must:
  1. Have an account on the Open WebUI instance where the link was generated.
  2. Be signed in to their account on that instance.
* If a user tries to access the shared link without being signed in, they will be redirected to the login page to log in before they can view the shared chat.

### Viewing Shared Chats

To view a shared chat:

1. Ensure you are signed in to an account on the Open WebUI instance where the chat was shared.
2. Click on the shared link provided to you.
3. The chat will be displayed in a read-only format.
4. If the Admin of the Open WebUI instance from which the shared link was shared has Text-to-Speech set up, there may be an audio button for messages to be read aloud to you (situational).

### Updating Shared Chats

To update a shared chat:

1. Select the chat conversation you want to share.
2. Click on the 3-dots that appear when hovering the mouse pointer above the desired chat.
3. Click on the **Share** option.
4. The **Share Chat** Modal should look different if you've shared a chat before.

The **Share Chat** Modal includes the following options:

* **before**: Opens a new tab to view the previously shared chat from the share link.
* **delete this link**: Deletes the shared link of the chat and presents the initial share chat modal.
* **Share to Open WebUI Community**: Opens a new tab for https://openwebui.com/chats/upload with the chat ready to be shared as a snapshot.
* **Update and Copy Link**: Updates the snapshot of the chat of the previously shared chat link and copies it to your device's clipboard.
