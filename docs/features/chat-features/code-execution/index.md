## Key Features

- **Python Code Execution**: Run Python scripts directly in your browser using Pyodide, with support for popular libraries like pandas and matplotlib with no setup required.

- **MermaidJS Rendering**: Create and visualize flowcharts, diagrams, and other visual representations with MermaidJS syntax that automatically renders in your chat.

- **Interactive Artifacts**: Generate and interact with rich content like HTML websites, SVG graphics, and JavaScript visualizations directly within your conversations.

These execution capabilities bridge the gap between conversation and implementation, allowing you to explore ideas, analyze data, and create visual content seamlessly while chatting with AI models.
