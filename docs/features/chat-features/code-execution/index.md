## Key Features

- **Python Code Execution**: Run Python scripts directly in your browser using Pyodide, with support for popular libraries like pandas and matplotlib with no setup required.

- **MermaidJS Rendering**: Create and visualize flowcharts, diagrams, and other visual representations with MermaidJS syntax that automatically renders in your chat.

- **Interactive Artifacts**: Generate and interact with rich content like HTML websites, SVG graphics, and JavaScript visualizations directly within your conversations.
