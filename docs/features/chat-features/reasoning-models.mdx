# Reasoning & Thinking Models

Open WebUI provides first-class support for models that exhibit "thinking" or "reasoning" behaviors (such as DeepSeek R1, OpenAI o1, and others). These models often generate internal chains of thought before providing a final answer.

## How Thinking Tags Work

When a model generates reasoning content, it typically wraps that content in specific XML-like tags (e.g., `<think>...</think>` or `<thought>...</thought>`). 

Open WebUI automatically:
1.  **Detects** these tags in the model's output stream.
2.  **Extracts** the content between the tags.
3.  **Renders** the extracted content in a collapsible UI element labeled "Thought" or "Thinking".

This keeps the main chat interface clean while still giving you access to the model's internal processing.

## The `reasoning_tags` Parameter

You can customize which tags Open WebUI should look for using the `reasoning_tags` parameter. This can be set on a **per-chat** or **per-model** basis.

### Default Tags
By default, Open WebUI looks for several common reasoning tag pairs:
- `<think>`, `</think>`
- `<thinking>`, `</thinking>`
- `<reason>`, `</reason>`
- `<reasoning>`, `</reasoning>`
- `<thought>`, `</thought>`
- `<|begin_of_thought|>`, `<|end_of_thought|>`

### Customization
If your model uses different tags, you can provide a list of tag pairs in the `reasoning_tags` parameter. Each pair is a tuple or list of the opening and closing tag.

## Configuration & Behavior

- **Stripping from Payload**: The `reasoning_tags` parameter itself is an Open WebUI-specific control and is **stripped** from the payload before being sent to the LLM backend (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.). This ensures compatibility with providers that do not recognize this parameter.
- **Chat History**: Thinking tags are **not** stripped from the chat history. If previous messages in a conversation contain thinking blocks, they are sent back to the model as part of the context, allowing the model to "remember" its previous reasoning steps.
- **UI Rendering**: Internally, reasoning blocks are processed and rendered using a specialized UI component. When saved or exported, they may be represented as HTML `<details type="reasoning">` tags.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is the thinking block showing as raw text?
If the model uses tags that are not in the default list and have not been configured in `reasoning_tags`, Open WebUI will treat them as regular text. You can fix this by adding the correct tags to the `reasoning_tags` parameter in the Model Settings or Chat Controls. For more advanced issues, see the **[Reasoning Models Troubleshooting Guide](/troubleshooting/reasoning-models)**.

### Does the model see its own thinking?
Generally, **no**. Because Open WebUI typically extracts the reasoning content into a separate field and removes the tags from the message's main `content` before it is saved or sent back as history, the model does not see its own previous reasoning in subsequent turns. This follows the design of reasoning models like OpenAI's `o1`, where the "chain of thought" is intended to be internal and ephemeral.
