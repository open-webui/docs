# Follow-Up Prompts

Open WebUI can automatically generate follow-up question suggestions after each model response. These suggestions appear as clickable chips below the response, helping you explore topics further without typing new prompts.

## Settings

Configure follow-up prompt behavior in **Settings > Interface** under the **Chat** section:

### Follow-Up Auto-Generation

**Default: On**

Automatically generates follow-up question suggestions after each response. These suggestions are generated by the [task model](/getting-started/env-configuration#task_model) based on the conversation context.

- **On**: Follow-up prompts are generated after each model response
- **Off**: No follow-up suggestions are generated

### Keep Follow-Up Prompts in Chat

**Default: Off**

By default, follow-up prompts only appear for the most recent message and disappear when you continue the conversation.

- **On**: Follow-up prompts are preserved and remain visible for all messages in the chat history
- **Off**: Only the last message shows follow-up prompts

:::tip Perfect for Knowledge Exploration
Enable this setting when exploring a knowledge base. You can see all the suggested follow-ups from previous responses, making it easy to revisit and explore alternative paths through the information.

### Insert Follow-Up Prompt to Input

**Default: Off**

Controls what happens when you click a follow-up prompt.

- **On**: Clicking a follow-up inserts the text into the input field, allowing you to edit it before sending
- **Off**: Clicking a follow-up immediately sends it as your next message

## Regenerating Follow-Ups

If you want to regenerate follow-up suggestions for a specific response, you can use the [Regenerate Followups](https://openwebui.com/f/silentoplayz/regenerate_followups) action button from the community.
