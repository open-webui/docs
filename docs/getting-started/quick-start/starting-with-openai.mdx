## Overview

Open WebUI makes it easy to connect and use OpenAI and other OpenAI-compatible APIs. This guide will walk you through adding your API key, setting the correct endpoint, and selecting models — so you can start chatting right away.

---

## Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

To use OpenAI models (such as GPT-4 or o3-mini), you need an API key from a supported provider.

You can use:

- OpenAI directly (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Azure OpenAI
- Any OpenAI-compatible service (e.g., LocalAI, FastChat, Helicone, LiteLLM, OpenRouter etc.)

👉 Once you have the key, copy it and keep it handy.

For most OpenAI usage, the default API base URL is:
https://api.openai.com/v1

Other providers use different URLs — check your provider’s documentation.

---

## Step 2: Add the API Connection in Open WebUI

Once Open WebUI is running:

1. Go to the ⚙️ **Admin Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Connections > OpenAI > Manage** (look for the wrench icon).
3. Click ➕ **Add New Connection**.
4. Fill in the following:
   - API URL: https://api.openai.com/v1 (or the URL of your specific provider)
   - API Key: Paste your key here

5. Click Save ✅.

This securely stores your credentials and sets up the connection.

Here’s what it looks like:

## Step 3: Start Using Models

Once your connection is saved, you can start using models right inside Open WebUI.

🧠 You don’t need to download any models — just select one from the Model Selector and start chatting. If a model is supported by your provider, you’ll be able to use it instantly via their API.

Here’s what model selection looks like:

Simply choose GPT-4, o3-mini, or any compatible model offered by your provider.
