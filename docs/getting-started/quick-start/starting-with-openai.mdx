## Overview

Open WebUI makes it easy to connect and use OpenAI and other OpenAI-compatible APIs. This guide will walk you through adding your API key, setting the correct endpoint, and selecting models — so you can start chatting right away.

---

## Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

To use OpenAI models (such as GPT-4 or o3-mini), you need an API key from a supported provider.

You can use:

- OpenAI directly (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Azure OpenAI
- Any OpenAI-compatible service (e.g., LocalAI, FastChat, Helicone, LiteLLM, OpenRouter etc.)

👉 Once you have the key, copy it and keep it handy.

For most OpenAI usage, the default API base URL is:
https://api.openai.com/v1

Other providers use different URLs — check your provider’s documentation.

## Step 2: Add the API Connection in Open WebUI

Once Open WebUI is running:

1. Go to the ⚙️ **Admin Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Connections > OpenAI > Manage** (look for the wrench icon).
3. Click ➕ **Add New Connection**.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="standard" label="Standard / Compatible" default>

  Use this for **OpenAI**, **DeepSeek**, **OpenRouter**, **LocalAI**, **FastChat**, **Helicone**, **LiteLLM**, etc.

  *   **Connection Type**: External
  *   **URL**: `https://api.openai.com/v1` (or your provider's endpoint)
  *   **API Key**: Your secret key (usually starts with `sk-...`)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="azure" label="Azure OpenAI">

  For Microsoft Azure OpenAI deployments.

  1.  Find **Provider Type** and click the button labeled **OpenAI** to switch it to **Azure OpenAI**.
  2.  **URL**: Your Azure Endpoint (e.g., `https://my-resource.openai.azure.com`).
  3.  **API Version**: e.g., `2024-02-15-preview`.
  4.  **API Key**: Your Azure API Key.
  5.  **Model IDs (Deployments)**: You **must** add your specific Deployment Names here (e.g., `my-gpt4-deployment`).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Advanced Configuration

*   **Model IDs (Filter)**:
    *   *Default (Empty)*: Auto-detects all available models from the provider.
    *   *Set*: Acts as an **Allowlist**. Only the specific model IDs you enter here will be visible to users. Use this to hide older or expensive models.
    
    :::tip OpenRouter Recommendation
    When using **OpenRouter**, we **highly recommend**:
    1.  **Use an allowlist** (add specific Model IDs). OpenRouter exposes thousands of models, which can clutter your model selector and slow down the admin panel if not filtered.
    2.  **Enable Model Caching** (`Settings > Connections > Cache Base Model List` or `ENABLE_BASE_MODELS_CACHE=True`). Without caching, page loads can take 10-15+ seconds on first visit due to querying a large number of models. See the [Performance Guide](/tutorials/tips/performance) for more details.
    :::
    
*   **Prefix ID**:
    *   If you connect multiple providers that have models with the same name (e.g., two providers both offering `llama3`), add a prefix here (e.g., `groq/`) to distinguish them. The model will appear as `groq/llama3`.

4. Click **Save** ✅.

This securely stores your credentials.

## Step 3: Start Using Models

Once your connection is saved, you can start using models right inside Open WebUI.

🧠 You don’t need to download any models — just select one from the Model Selector and start chatting. If a model is supported by your provider, you’ll be able to use it instantly via their API.

Here’s what model selection looks like:

Simply choose GPT-4, o3-mini, or any compatible model offered by your provider.
