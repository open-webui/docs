# Updating with Python

To update your locally installed **Open-WebUI** package to the latest version using `pip`, follow these simple steps:

```bash
pip install -U open-webui
```

The `-U` (or `--upgrade`) flag ensures that `pip` upgrades the package to the latest available version.

That's it! Your **Open-WebUI** package is now updated and ready to use.
