## Overview

Open WebUI makes it easy to connect and manage your **Ollama** instance. This guide will walk you through setting up the connection, managing models, and getting started.

---

## Step 1: Setting Up the Ollama Connection

Once Open WebUI is installed and running, it will automatically attempt to connect to your Ollama instance. If everything goes smoothly, youâ€™ll be ready to manage and use models right away.

However, if you encounter connection issues, the most common cause is a network misconfiguration. You can refer to our [connection troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/connection-error) for help resolving these problems.

## Step 2: Managing Your Ollama Instance

To manage your Ollama instance in Open WebUI, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Admin Settings** in Open WebUI.
2. Navigate to **Connections > Ollama > Manage** (click the wrench icon).  
   From here, you can download models, configure settings, and manage your connection to Ollama.

Hereâ€™s what the management screen looks like:

## A Quick and Efficient Way to Download Models

If youâ€™re looking for a faster option to get started, you can download models directly from the **Model Selector**. Simply type the name of the model you want, and if itâ€™s not already available, Open WebUI will prompt you to download it from Ollama.

Hereâ€™s an example of how it works:

This method is perfect if you want to skip navigating through the Admin Settings menu and get right to using your models.
