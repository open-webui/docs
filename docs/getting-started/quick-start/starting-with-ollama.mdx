## Overview

Open WebUI makes it easy to connect and manage your **Ollama** instance. This guide will walk you through setting up the connection, managing models, and getting started.

---

## Step 1: Setting Up the Ollama Connection

Once Open WebUI is installed and running, it will automatically attempt to connect to your Ollama instance. If everything goes smoothly, you’ll be ready to manage and use models right away.

However, if you encounter connection issues, the most common cause is a network misconfiguration. You can refer to our [connection troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/connection-error) for help resolving these problems.

## Step 2: Managing Your Ollama Instance

To manage your Ollama instance in Open WebUI, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Admin Settings** in Open WebUI.
2. Navigate to **Connections > Ollama > Manage** (click the wrench icon).
   From here, you can download models, configure settings, and manage your connection to Ollama.

Here’s what the management screen looks like:

## A Quick and Efficient Way to Download Models

If you’re looking for a faster option to get started, you can download models directly from the **Model Selector**. Simply type the name of the model you want, and if it’s not already available, Open WebUI will prompt you to download it from Ollama.

Here’s an example of how it works:

This method is perfect if you want to skip navigating through the Admin Settings menu and get right to using your models.
