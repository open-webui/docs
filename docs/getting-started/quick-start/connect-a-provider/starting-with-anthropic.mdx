## Overview

Open WebUI supports **Anthropic's Claude models** natively through their OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Just plug in your API key and start chatting — no middleware, no pipes, no extra setup required.

Open WebUI includes a built-in compatibility layer that automatically detects Anthropic URLs, handles model discovery, and translates requests. Chat completions, streaming, and **tool calling** all work correctly out of the box.

:::warning Anthropic's Compatibility Disclaimer
Anthropic states that their OpenAI-compatible API is intended **for evaluation and testing**, not production workloads. In practice, everything — including tool calling — works as intended, but be aware of this official stance. For full Claude-native features (PDF processing, citations, extended thinking, prompt caching), Anthropic recommends their native `/v1/messages` API, which can be accessed via a [pipe function](/features/extensibility/plugin/functions/pipe) or a proxy like [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/).

## Step 3: Start Chatting!

That's it! Open WebUI automatically detects the Anthropic endpoint and fetches available models. Select a Claude model from the model dropdown and you're good to go.

Streaming, multi-turn conversations, and tool calling all work seamlessly.

:::info Optional: Filter Models
If you want only specific models to appear, you can add model IDs to the **Model IDs (Filter)** allowlist in the connection settings. Common model IDs:

| Model | ID |
|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514` |
| Claude Opus 4 | `claude-opus-4-0-20250514` |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` |
| Claude Haiku 3.5 | `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` |

Check [Anthropic's model documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models) for the latest available model IDs.
