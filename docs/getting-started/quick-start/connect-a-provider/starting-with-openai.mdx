## Overview

Open WebUI makes it easy to connect to **OpenAI** and **Azure OpenAI**. This guide will walk you through adding your API key, setting the correct endpoint, and selecting models — so you can start chatting right away.

For other providers that offer an OpenAI-compatible API (Google Gemini, Mistral, Groq, DeepSeek, and many more), see the **[OpenAI-Compatible Providers](/getting-started/quick-start/connect-a-provider/starting-with-openai-compatible)** guide. For Anthropic's Claude models, see the dedicated **[Anthropic (Claude)](/getting-started/quick-start/connect-a-provider/starting-with-anthropic)** guide.

## Important: Protocols, Not Providers

Open WebUI is a **protocol-centric** platform. While we provide first-class support for OpenAI models, we do so mainly through the **OpenAI Chat Completions API protocol**.

We focus on universal standards shared across dozens of providers, with experimental support for emerging standards like **[Open Responses](https://www.openresponses.org/)**. For a detailed explanation, see our **[FAQ on protocol support](/faq#q-why-doesnt-open-webui-natively-support-provider-xs-proprietary-api)**.

## Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

- **OpenAI**: Get your key at [platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- **Azure OpenAI**: Get your key from the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

## Step 2: Add the API Connection in Open WebUI

Once Open WebUI is running:

1. Go to the ⚙️ **Admin Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Connections > OpenAI > Manage** (look for the wrench icon).
3. Click ➕ **Add New Connection**.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="standard" label="OpenAI" default>

  *   **Connection Type**: External
  *   **URL**: `https://api.openai.com/v1`
  *   **API Key**: Your secret key (starts with `sk-...`)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="azure" label="Azure OpenAI">

  For Microsoft Azure OpenAI deployments.

  1.  Find **Provider Type** and click the button labeled **OpenAI** to switch it to **Azure OpenAI**.
  2.  **URL**: Your Azure Endpoint (e.g., `https://my-resource.openai.azure.com`).
  3.  **API Version**: e.g., `2024-02-15-preview`.
  4.  **API Key**: Your Azure API Key.
  5.  **Model IDs (Deployments)**: You **must** add your specific Deployment Names here (e.g., `my-gpt4-deployment`).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Advanced Configuration

*   **Model IDs (Filter)**:
    *   *Default (Empty)*: Auto-detects all available models from the provider.
    *   *Set*: Acts as an **Allowlist**. Only the specific model IDs you enter here will be visible to users. Use this to hide older or expensive models.

*   **Prefix ID**:
    *   If you connect multiple providers that have models with the same name (e.g., two providers both offering `llama3`), add a prefix here (e.g., `groq/`) to distinguish them. The model will appear as `groq/llama3`.

4. Click **Save** ✅.

This securely stores your credentials.

:::tip Connection Timeout Configuration

If your API provider is slow to respond or you're experiencing timeout issues, you can adjust the model list fetch timeout:

```bash
# Increase timeout for slow networks (default is 10 seconds)
AIOHTTP_CLIENT_TIMEOUT_MODEL_LIST=15
```

If you've saved an unreachable URL and the UI becomes unresponsive, see the [Model List Loading Issues](/troubleshooting/connection-error#️-model-list-loading-issues-slow-ui--unreachable-endpoints) troubleshooting guide for recovery options.

## Step 3: Start Using Models

Once your connection is saved, you can start using models right inside Open WebUI.

🧠 You don't need to download any models — just select one from the Model Selector and start chatting. If a model is supported by your provider, you'll be able to use it instantly via their API.

Here's what model selection looks like:

![OpenAI Model Selector](/images/getting-started/quick-start/selector-openai.png)

Simply choose GPT-4, o3-mini, or any compatible model offered by your provider.

## All Set!

That's it! Your OpenAI API connection is ready to use.
