## Overview

Did you know Open WebUI can connect to almost **anything**—not just OpenAI-compatible APIs?

Thanks to **Pipe Functions**, you can bring in services that don’t support the OpenAI API (like **Anthropic**, Home Assistant, Google Search, or *any* Python codebase). No restrictions on LLMs or AI models: if you can automate it in Python, you can turn it into a plugin for Open WebUI!

This guide walks you through setting up your first Pipe Function, using the [Anthropic Pipe](https://openwebui.com/f/justinrahb/anthropic) plugin as an example.

## What are Pipe Functions?

Pipe Functions are “bring-your-own-model (or tool)” plugins:

- **Act like models**: They show up as selectable models in your Open WebUI sidebar.
- **Flexible**: Integrate with *any* backend, API, or workflow—no OpenAI compatibility required.
- **No LLM required**: You can build plugins for search, home automation, weather, databases, or whatever you like.
- **Pure Python**: All logic is Python code that runs *directly inside* your WebUI (so be cautious with what you enable!).

## Step 1: Find a Pipe Function to Try

Functions are powerful tools, and the community has created thousands of them! You can browse, search, and import them directly from our community hub.

:::info Community Account Required
To search and import functions directly from **[Open WebUI Community](https://openwebui.com/search)**, you must be logged in with a registered community account.
:::

1.  Go to **[Open WebUI Community Search](https://openwebui.com/search)**.
2.  Explore the library! You can find functions for:
    *   **New Providers**: Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq.
    *   **Tools**: Web Search, Calculator, Home Assistant control.
    *   **Utilities**: Auto-tagging, content filtering, and more.
3.  **Pro Tip**: Even if you don't find exactly what you need, you can use existing functions as **templates** to build your own!

For this guide, let's try integrating **Anthropic** (Claude models):

1.  Locate the [Anthropic Pipe](https://openwebui.com/f/justinrahb/anthropic) function.
2.  Click **Get**.

## Step 2: Import the Function to Open WebUI

A modal will appear:

1. Enter your Open WebUI URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) in the prompt.
2. Click **Import to Open WebUI**.

You’ll be redirected **directly to the Functions Editor** within your running instance of Open WebUI.

## Step 3: Review & Save

- You’ll see all of the Pipe Function’s Python code and configuration.
- **Important:** Functions run arbitrary Python! Review the code for safety, and only install from sources you trust.
- If you’re happy with the code, click **Save** to add it to your instance.

## Step 4: Enable the Function

Your new Pipe Function is now available, but **must be enabled**:

1. Switch the toggler to enable the function.

## Step 5: Enter any Required API Keys via Valves

Some functions need credentials (like Anthropic’s API key):

1. Click on the Gear icon next to the switch to open the **Valves** configuration.
2. Input your required API key(s) for the Pipe Function.

## Step 6: Start Using Your New Plugin!

- The new function now appears as a selectable “model” in the chat interface.
- Select `Anthropic` (or whatever you installed), and start chatting!

## 🎉 That’s It—You’re Plugged Into Anything!

- Pipe Functions open Open WebUI to *any* API, model, or automation—not just OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- Think beyond LLMs: Integrate tools, APIs, local scripts, or your entire smart home.

## ⚠️ Security Notes

- **Always** review function code before enabling.
- Only use plugins from trusted sources.
- You have the power to enhance (or break!) your WebUI—use responsibly.
