# Docker Desktop Extension
Docker has released an Open WebUI Docker extension that uses Docker Model Runner for inference. You can read their getting started blog here: [Run Local AI with Open WebUI + Docker Model Runner](https://www.docker.com/blog/open-webui-docker-desktop-model-runner/)

You can find troubleshooting steps for the extension in their Github repository: [Open WebUI Docker Extension - Troubleshooting](https://github.com/rw4lll/open-webui-docker-extension?tab=readme-ov-file#troubleshooting)

While this is an amazing resource to try out Open WebUI with little friction, it is not an officially supported installation method - you may run into unexpected bugs or behaviors while using it. For example, you are not able to log in as different users in the extension since it is designed to be for a single local user. If you run into issues using the extension, please submit an issue on the extension's [Github repository](https://github.com/rw4lll/open-webui-docker-extension).
