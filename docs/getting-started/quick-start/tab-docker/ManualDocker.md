## Quick Start with Docker

:::tip `:dev` is the pre-release build, and the newest fixes are in it
Think of `:dev` as the nightly: it is rebuilt from the `dev` branch every time a change lands, and it becomes the next release unchanged. Fixes reach it the day they are made, which is often weeks before they reach `:main`.

Swap the tag on any command on this page:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui-dev:/app/backend/data --name open-webui-dev ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

Installing it is your call, and it is a genuinely useful one: pre-release builds are tested by the people who choose to run them. Give it **its own volume**, as above, and run it beside your normal instance rather than in place of it. Full details in [Using the Dev Branch](#using-the-dev-branch).

:::info
**WebSocket** support is required. Ensure your network configuration allows WebSocket connections.

:::tip Docker Hub Now Available
Open WebUI images are published to **both** registries:
- **GitHub Container Registry:** `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui`
- **Docker Hub:** `openwebui/open-webui`

Both contain identical images. Replace `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui` with `openwebui/open-webui` in any command below.
:::

### 1. Pull the image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### 2. Run the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` | Persistent storage. Prevents data loss between restarts. |
| `-p 3000:8080` | Exposes the UI on port 3000 of your machine. |

### 3. Open the UI

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Image Variants

| Tag | Use case |
|-----|----------|
| `:main` | Standard image (recommended) |
| `:dev` | Pre-release (nightly) build from the `dev` branch. Fixes and features arrive here first. |
| `:main-slim` | Smaller image, downloads Whisper and embedding models on first use |
| `:cuda` | Nvidia GPU support (add `--gpus all` to `docker run`) |
| `:ollama` | Bundles Ollama inside the container for an all-in-one setup |

### How the tags update

`:main` and `:latest` are the **same rolling image**: both point to the newest build from the `main` branch and are rebuilt every time a change lands there, so their digest moves forward as development continues. Note that `:latest` follows `main`; it does **not** point to the newest stable release.

`:dev` is the same idea for the `dev` branch, also rolling. That is the pre-release, effectively a nightly build, and it carries fixes and features weeks before they appear under `:main`.

Version tags, such as `:vX.Y.Z` and the shorter `:X.Y.Z` and `:X.Y`, are **pinned** to one stable release and never change. `:git-<commit-sha>` pins one exact commit.

This is why `:main` and a specific release tag can show different image digests at the same time: `:main` already includes everything merged since that release, while the version tag stays frozen at it.

| Tag | Points to | Immutable? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `:main`, `:latest` | Newest build of the `main` branch | No (rolling) |
| `:dev` | Newest build of the `dev` branch, the pre-release | No (rolling) |
| `:vX.Y.Z`, `:X.Y.Z`, `:X.Y` | A specific stable release | Yes |
| `:git-<sha>` | One exact commit | Yes |

For reproducible or production deployments, pin a version tag. For the newest build, use `:main` (or the identical `:latest`). For the next release before it is released, use `:dev`.

### Specific release versions

For production environments, pin a specific version instead of using floating tags. Replace `X.Y.Z` with a version from the [releases page](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/releases):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:vX.Y.Z
docker pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:vX.Y.Z-cuda
docker pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:vX.Y.Z-ollama
```

## Common Configurations

### GPU support (Nvidia)

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
```

### Bundled with Ollama

A single container with Open WebUI and Ollama together:

**With GPU:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
```

**CPU only:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v ollama:/root/.ollama -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:ollama
```

### Connecting to Ollama on a different server

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

### Single-user mode (no login)

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e WEBUI_AUTH=False -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

:::warning
You cannot switch between single-user mode and multi-account mode after this change.

## Using the Dev Branch

`:dev` is Open WebUI's pre-release channel, and in practice a nightly build: the image is rebuilt from the `dev` branch as changes land, and every change lands there before it lands anywhere else. There is no separate beta programme, because `dev` fills that role. Changes that reach it are not reverted, so the next release is `dev` as it stands on release day.

That has two consequences worth knowing:

- **If you are waiting on a fix, it is probably already available.** Check the [changelog](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md) on `dev`, then run `:dev` rather than waiting for the release.
- **If you run Open WebUI for other people, testing the pre-release is how you avoid surprises.** A second instance on `:dev` shows you the next release before your users meet it, and tells you whether your plugins, your models and your configuration still behave.

Whether to run it is entirely your decision, and running it is what makes releases good. A pre-release is only as well tested as the number of people who choose to install it, and that number is currently small.

Setup is the same as any other image, with the tag changed:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -v open-webui-dev:/app/backend/data --name open-webui-dev --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:dev
```

:::warning Use a separate volume
**Never share a data volume between dev and production.** Dev builds may include database migrations that a release image cannot read back, so a shared volume can leave you unable to go back to `:main`. The `-v open-webui-dev:/app/backend/data` above is a different volume from the `open-webui` one used elsewhere on this page, and that is deliberate. The container name differs too, so both can run at once.
:::

Anything that looks wrong on `:dev` is worth reporting on [GitHub](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues). Reports at that stage get fixed before the release instead of after it, which is the whole point of a pre-release existing.

If Docker is not your preference, follow the [Developing Open WebUI](/getting-started/advanced-topics/development).

## Uninstall

1. **Stop and remove the container:**
    ```bash
    docker rm -f open-webui
    ```

2. **Remove the image (optional):**
    ```bash
    docker rmi ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
    ```

3. **Remove the volume (optional, deletes all data):**
    ```bash
    docker volume rm open-webui
    ```
