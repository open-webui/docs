## Overview

vLLM provides an OpenAI-compatible API, making it easy to connect to Open WebUI. This guide will show you how to connect your vLLM server.

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your vLLM Server

Make sure your vLLM server is running and accessible. The default API base URL is typically:

```
http://localhost:8000/v1
```

For remote servers, use the appropriate hostname or IP address.

## Step 2: Add the API Connection in Open WebUI

1. Go to ⚙️ **Admin Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Connections > OpenAI > Manage** (look for the wrench icon).
3. Click ➕ **Add New Connection**.
4. Select the **Standard / Compatible** tab (if available).
5. Fill in the following:
   - **API URL**: `http://localhost:8000/v1` (or your vLLM server URL)
     *   **Docker Users**: Use `http://host.docker.internal:8000/v1` if Open WebUI is in a container.
   - **API Key**: `none` (or leave empty if no key is configured)
6. Click **Save**.

## Step 3: Start Using Models
