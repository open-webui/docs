## Overview

Did you know Open WebUI can connect to almost **anything**‚Äînot just OpenAI-compatible APIs?

Thanks to **Pipe Functions**, you can bring in services that don‚Äôt support the OpenAI API (like **Anthropic**, Home Assistant, Google Search, or *any* Python codebase). No restrictions on LLMs or AI models: if you can automate it in Python, you can turn it into a plugin for Open WebUI!

This guide walks you through setting up your first Pipe Function, using the [Anthropic Pipe](https://openwebui.com/f/justinrahb/anthropic) plugin as an example.

## What are Pipe Functions?

Pipe Functions are ‚Äúbring-your-own-model (or tool)‚Äù plugins:

- **Act like models**: They show up as selectable models in your Open WebUI sidebar.
- **Flexible**: Integrate with *any* backend, API, or workflow‚Äîno OpenAI compatibility required.
- **No LLM required**: You can build plugins for search, home automation, weather, databases, or whatever you like.
- **Pure Python**: All logic is Python code that runs *directly inside* your WebUI (so be cautious with what you enable!).

## Step 1: Find a Pipe Function to Try

Let‚Äôs integrate **Anthropic** with Open WebUI‚Äîeven though Anthropic only supports its own native API (not OpenAI-compatible endpoints)!

1. Go to the [Anthropic Chat function page](https://openwebui.com/f/justinrahb/anthropic).

2. Click **Get**.

## Step 2: Import the Function to Open WebUI

A modal will appear:

1. Enter your Open WebUI URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) in the prompt.
2. Click **Import to Open WebUI**.

You‚Äôll be redirected **directly to the Functions Editor** within your running instance of Open WebUI.

## Step 3: Review & Save

- You‚Äôll see all of the Pipe Function‚Äôs Python code and configuration.
- **Important:** Functions run arbitrary Python! Review the code for safety, and only install from sources you trust.
- If you‚Äôre happy with the code, click **Save** to add it to your instance.

## Step 4: Enable the Function

Your new Pipe Function is now available, but **must be enabled**:

1. Switch the toggler to enable the function.

## Step 5: Enter any Required API Keys via Valves

Some functions need credentials (like Anthropic‚Äôs API key):

1. Click on the Gear icon next to the switch to open the **Valves** configuration.
2. Input your required API key(s) for the Pipe Function.

## Step 6: Start Using Your New Plugin!

- The new function now appears as a selectable ‚Äúmodel‚Äù in the chat interface.
- Select `Anthropic` (or whatever you installed), and start chatting!

## üéâ That‚Äôs It‚ÄîYou‚Äôre Plugged Into Anything!

- Pipe Functions open Open WebUI to *any* API, model, or automation‚Äînot just OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- Think beyond LLMs: Integrate tools, APIs, local scripts, or your entire smart home.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes

- **Always** review function code before enabling.
- Only use plugins from trusted sources.
- You have the power to enhance (or break!) your WebUI‚Äîuse responsibly.
