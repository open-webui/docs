Everything you need to go from zero to running—and beyond.

## ⏱️ Quick Start

Get Open WebUI running, then connect it to your models. Most users start here.

**What's inside:**

- Docker installation (with and without bundled Ollama)
- Python/uv installation
- Connecting to model providers (Ollama, OpenAI, vLLM, Llama.cpp, and more)
- Your first custom function

Whether you're running locally or connecting to external APIs, this is your launchpad.

Running in production? Securing for your team? Go deeper.

**What's inside:**

- Local development and contributing
- Network architecture and diagrams
- Logging and debugging
- HTTPS and reverse proxy setup
- Monitoring and observability (OpenTelemetry)

Yeah, it's a few steps. Worth it though.
