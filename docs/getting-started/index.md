### Installing Docker

#### For Windows and Mac Users:

- Download Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- Follow the installation instructions provided on the website. After installation, open Docker Desktop to ensure it's running properly.

#### For Ubuntu Users:
1. **Open your terminal.**

2. **Set up Docker's apt repository:**
   - Update your package index:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     ```
   - Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
     ```
   - Create a directory for the Docker apt keyring:
     ```bash
     sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
     ```
   - Add Docker's official GPG key:
     ```bash
     sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
     sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
     ```
   - Add the Docker repository to Apt sources:
     ```bash
     echo \
       "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
       $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
       sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
     ```
     Note: If you're using an Ubuntu derivative distro, such as Linux Mint, you might need to use `UBUNTU_CODENAME` instead of `VERSION_CODENAME`.

3. **Install Docker Engine:**
   - Update your package index again:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     ```
   - Install Docker Engine, CLI, and containerd:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
     ```

4. **Verify the Docker installation:**
   - Use the following command to run a test image:
     ```bash
     sudo docker run hello-world
     ```
     This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. If successful, it prints an informational message confirming that Docker is installed and working correctly.

#### Other Linux Distributions:

- For other Linux distributions, please refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for installation instructions specific to your distro.

### Ensure You Have the Latest Version of Ollama:

- Download the latest version from [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/).

### Verify Ollama Installation:

- After installing Ollama, verify its functionality by accessing [http://127.0.0.1:11434/](http://127.0.0.1:11434/) in your web browser. Note that the port number might be different based on your installation.

</details>

## One-line Command to Install Ollama and Open WebUI Together

#### Using Docker Compose

- If you don't have Ollama yet, use Docker Compose for easy installation. Run this command:

  ```bash
  docker compose up -d --build
  ```

- **For GPU Support:** Use an additional Docker Compose file:

  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.gpu.yaml up -d --build
  ```

- **To Expose Ollama API:** Use another Docker Compose file:

  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.api.yaml up -d --build
  ```

#### Using `run-compose.sh` Script (Linux or Docker-Enabled WSL2 on Windows)

- Give execute permission to the script:

  ```bash
  chmod +x run-compose.sh
  ```

- For CPU-only container:

  ```bash
  ./run-compose.sh
  ```

- For GPU support (read the note about GPU compatibility):

  ```bash
  ./run-compose.sh --enable-gpu
  ```

- To build the latest local version, add `--build`:

  ```bash
  ./run-compose.sh --enable-gpu --build
  ```

## Quick Start with Docker üê≥

:::info
When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.
:::

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

- To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server's URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- After installation, you can access Open WebUI at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Enjoy! üòÑ

#### Open WebUI: Server Connection Error

Encountering connection issues between the Open WebUI Docker container and the Ollama server? This problem often arises because distro-packaged versions of Docker‚Äîlike those from the Ubuntu repository‚Äîdo not support the `host.docker.internal` alias for reaching the host directly. Inside a container, referring to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` typically points back to the container itself, not the host machine.

To address this, we recommend using the `--network=host` flag in your Docker command. This flag allows the container to use the host's networking stack, effectively making `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` in the container refer to the host machine. As a result, the WebUI can successfully connect to the Ollama server at `127.0.0.1:11434`. Please note, with `--network=host`, the container's port configuration aligns directly with the host, changing the access link to `http://localhost:8080`.

**Here's how you can modify your Docker command**:

```bash
docker run -d --network=host -v open-webui:/app/backend/data -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

## Installing with Podman

<details>
<summary>Rootless (Podman) local-only Open WebUI with Systemd service and auto-update</summary>

- **Important:** Consult the Docker documentation because much of the configuration and syntax is interchangeable with [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman). See also [rootless_tutorial](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md). This example requires the [slirp4netns](https://github.com/rootless-containers/slirp4netns) network backend to facilitate server listen and Ollama communication over localhost only.

1. Pull the latest image:
   ```bash
   podman pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
   ```
2. Create a new container using desired configuration:

   **Note:** `-p 127.0.0.1:3000:8080` ensures that we listen only on localhost, `--network slirp4netns:allow_host_loopback=true` permits the container to access Ollama when it also listens strictly on localhost. `--add-host=ollama.local:10.0.2.2 --env 'OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://ollama.local:11434'` adds a hosts record to the container and configures open-webui to use the friendly hostname. `10.0.2.2` is the default slirp4netns address used for localhost mapping. `--env 'ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False'` isn't necessary since Chroma telemetry has been disabled in the code but is included as an example.

   ```bash
   podman create -p 127.0.0.1:3000:8080 --network slirp4netns:allow_host_loopback=true --add-host=ollama.local:10.0.2.2 --env 'OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://ollama.local:11434' --env 'ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False' -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --label io.containers.autoupdate=registry --name open-webui ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
   ```

3. Prepare for systemd user service:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
   ```
4. Generate user service with Podman:
   ```bash
   podman generate systemd --new open-webui > ~/.config/systemd/user/open-webui.service
   ```
5. Reload systemd configuration:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user daemon-reload
   ```
6. Enable and validate new service:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user enable open-webui.service
   systemctl --user start open-webui.service
   systemctl --user status open-webui.service
   ```
7. Enable and validate Podman auto-update:
   ```bash
   systemctl --user enable podman-auto-update.timer
   systemctl --user enable podman-auto-update.service
   systemctl --user status podman-auto-update.timer
   ```
   Dry run with the following command (omit `--dry-run` to force an update):
   ```bash
   podman auto-update --dry-run
   ```

### Updating your Docker Installation

For detailed instructions on manually updating your local Docker installation of Open WebUI, including steps for those not using Watchtower and updates via Docker Compose, please refer to our dedicated guide: [UPDATING](/getting-started/updating).

For a quick update with Watchtower, use the command below. Remember to replace `open-webui` with your actual container name if it differs.

```bash
docker run --rm --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock containrrr/watchtower --run-once open-webui
```

In the last part of the command, replace `open-webui` with your container name if it is different.
