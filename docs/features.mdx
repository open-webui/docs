## Key Features of Open WebUI ⭐

- 🚀 **Effortless Setup**: Install seamlessly using Docker or Kubernetes (`kubectl`, `kustomize` or `helm`) for a hassle-free experience with support for both `:ollama` and `:cuda` tagged images.

- 🤝 **OpenAI API Integration**: Effortlessly integrate OpenAI-compatible APIs for versatile conversations alongside Ollama models. Customize the OpenAI API URL to link with `LMStudio`, `GroqCloud`, `Mistral`, `OpenRouter`, **and more**.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across Desktop PC, Laptop, and Mobile devices.

- 📱 **Progressive Web App for Mobile**: Enjoy a native progressive web app experience on your mobile device, featuring offline access on localhost or a personal domain, and a smooth user interface. For our PWA to be installable on your device, it must be served in a secure context. This usually means that it must be served over HTTPS.
  - To set up a PWA, you'll need some understanding of technologies like Linux, Docker, and reverse proxies such as `Nginx`, `Caddy`, or `Traefik`. Using these tools can help streamline the process for creating and deploying your PWA tailored to your needs. And while there isn't a "one-click install" option available and your available option for serving your Open WebUI instance securely over HTTPS takes user-experience, using these resources can make it easier to create and deploy a PWA tailored to your needs.
