## Key Features of Open WebUI ⭐

- 🚀 **Effortless Setup**: Install seamlessly using Docker or Kubernetes (`kubectl`, `kustomize` or `helm`) for a hassle-free experience with support for both `:ollama` and `:cuda` tagged images.

- 🤝 **OpenAI API Integration**: Effortlessly integrate OpenAI-compatible APIs for versatile conversations alongside Ollama models. The OpenAI API URL can be customized to link with various third-party applications.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across desktop PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.

- 📱 **Progressive Web App for Mobile**: Enjoy a native progressive web application experience on your mobile device with offline access on `localhost` or a personal domain, and a smooth user interface. In order for our PWA to be installable on your device, it must be delivered in a secure context. This usually means that it must be served over HTTPS.
  - To set up a PWA, you'll need some understanding of technologies like Linux, Docker, and reverse proxies such as `Nginx`, `Caddy`, or `Traefik`. Using these tools can help streamline the process of building and deploying a PWA tailored to your needs. While there's no "one-click install" option available, and your available option to securely deploy your Open WebUI instance over HTTPS requires user experience, using these resources can make it easier to create and deploy a PWA tailored to your needs.
