# Open WebUI Roadmap! 🌟

At Open WebUI, we're committed to continually enhancing our platform to provide the best experience for our users. Below, you'll find the structured roadmap for our ongoing and future developments, categorized into Interface, Information Retrieval, and Community.

## Interface 🖥️

Our roadmap for interface innovations aims to create a highly intuitive and accessible platform. These will not only improves user satisfaction but also enhance productivity by reducing the cognitive load on users.


- 💬 **"Channels" Feature**: Integrating a built-in chat solution for Open WebUI users that includes AI moderation and assistance capabilities can significantly enhance user engagement and provide timely assistance, improving overall user satisfaction and retention.

- 🧠 **AI Workflow Tool**: A node-based tool to orchestrate and compose multiple aspects of AI systems. This tool will allow users to visually connect different AI modules and services, creating complex workflows with ease. It's designed to empower users to harness the full potential of AI without needing deep technical knowledge in AI programming.

- 📈 **Analytics Dashboard**: A robust analytics platform will allow users to gain insights into their application performance and user activities, empowering them with data to make informed decisions and improve user experiences.

- 🔊 **Local Text-to-Speech Integration**: This feature will allow natural language processing to convert text into lifelike spoken audio, thus making the platform more accessible, especially for visually impaired users. This integration helps in consuming information without screen interaction, facilitating multitasking and improving user engagement.

- 🔧 **Fine-tune Model (LoRA)**: This feature allows users to adjust specific parameters of the model directly through the UI. Fine-tuning can significantly boost the model’s efficiency by adapting it to specific contexts or industries, enhancing personalization and relevancy of responses.

- 📣 **Wakeword Detection**: Incorporating hands-free operation through voice commands will not only enhance accessibility but also align with emerging trends in IoT and smart environments, making our platform future-ready.

- 💻 **Better Code Execution**: Enhancing coding functionalities within the platform supports a broad range of development activities, making it a one-stop solution for developers, thereby attracting a wider tech audience and fostering a robust developer community.

- 🤖 **Code Interpreter Function**: A flexible code interpreter embedded into the platform can support multiple programming languages, which reduces the dependency on external tools and streamlines the development process, increasing efficiency.

- 📦 **Packaged Single Binary Executable**: Simplifying deployment and ensuring compatibility across different platforms, we aim to offer our interface as a single binary executable. This approach will facilitate effortless installation and updates, significantly enhancing usability for all users, especially those with limited technical expertise.

## Information Retrieval (RAG) 📚

Open WebUI currently provides an interface that enables the use of existing information retrieval (IR) models efficiency. However, we believe there is vast potential for improvement. We fully recognize the limitations of our current RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation in our WebUI, understanding that a one-size-fits-all approach does not effectively meet all users' needs. 

To address this, we are committed to transforming our framework to be highly modular and extensively configurable. This new direction will enable users to tailor the information retrieval process to their specific requirements with ease, using a straightforward, interactive interface that allows for simple drag-and-drop customization. This refinement aims to significantly enhance user experience by providing a more adaptable and personalized IR setup.

Here's our focused plan for advancing our information retrieval capabilities:

- 🌐 **Customizable RAG Framework**: Envision a future where you can effortlessly tailor your IR setup via a user-friendly interface. This will include modular components that users can drag, drop, and configure without needing deep technical knowledge.

- 🔄 **Advanced Integration with SoTA Methods**: We aim to incorporate the latest developments in retrieval methods, enhancing accuracy and efficiency with advanced techniques and architectures.

- 🔍 **Dedicated R&D**: We’re scaling up our research and development to discover and integrate novel retrieval methods that push the boundaries of current methods, in collaboration with leading research entities.

## Community 🤝

We aim to create a vibrant community where everyone can contribute to and benefit from shared knowledge and developments:

- 🏆 **LLM Leaderboard**: A community-driven approach to evaluate and rank models ensures transparency and continuous improvement, leveraging real-world applications to benchmark performance instead of relying on standard datasets that might not reflect practical utility.

- 👥 **Sub-Communities**: Encouraging niche communities to curate datasets and optimize prompts can lead to better-tuned models, as these communities have specific insights and detailed feedback that typically go unnoticed in broader datasets.

# Vision for the Future 🔭

Our relentless effort stems from a clear vision we hold dearly: enhancing your daily life, saving time and allowing for more focus on what truly matters. 

Imagine a world where you think, and it happens. You desire a cup of coffee made exactly the way you love, and it's brewed for you. A world where you, simply think of a comprehensive data analysis report in a particular format, and it's done at the speed of your thought. The core idea is to turn the time-consuming, routine tasks over to our AI interface, freeing up your time and attention.

This isn’t a sci-fi future; together, we are working towards it right now. As our AI models gradually become more capable and intuitively understand your specific needs, your most mundane responsibilities become automated. Through this profound shift, our collective time allowance can be redistributed towards grand endeavours. Think space exploration, longevity research or simply extra moments with loved ones. 

Creating this imagined future won't be a walk in the park, but with your help, we believe it's within our reach. Open WebUI is more than just tech - it's there to enhance your day, giving you more space for what's really important. Together, we're working on a brighter tomorrow. Thanks for joining us in this extraordinary journey.
