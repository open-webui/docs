### 🤝 Community Support 

This project thrives on community spirit and passion. If you still face problems after updating, we warmly invite you to join our vibrant community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5rJgQTnV4s). There, you can share your experiences, find solutions, and connect with fellow enthusiasts who might be navigating similar challenges.
