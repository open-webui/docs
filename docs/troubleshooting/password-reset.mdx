# Resetting Your Admin Password 🗝️

If you've forgotten your admin password, don't worry! Below you'll find step-by-step guides to reset your admin password for Docker 🐳 deployments and local installations of Open WebUI.

## For Docker Deployments 🐳

Follow these steps to reset the admin password for Open WebUI when deployed using Docker.

### Step 1: Generate a New Password Hash 🔐

First, you need to create a bcrypt hash of your new password. Run the following command on your local machine, replacing `your-new-password` with the password you wish to use:

```bash
htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" your-new-password | tr -d ':\n'
```

### Step 2: Update the Password in Docker 🔄

Next, you'll update the password in your Docker deployment. Replace `HASH` in the command below with the bcrypt hash generated in Step 1. Also, replace `admin@example.com` with the email address linked to your admin account.

```bash
docker run --rm -v open-webui:/data alpine/socat EXEC:"bash -c 'apk add sqlite && echo UPDATE auth SET password='\''HASH'\'' WHERE email='\''admin@example.com'\''; | sqlite3 /data/webui.db'", STDIO
```

## For Local Installations 💻

If you have a local installation of Open WebUI, here's how you can reset your admin password directly on your system.

### Step 1: Generate a New Password Hash 🔐

Just as with the Docker method, start by generating a bcrypt hash of your new password using the following command. Remember to replace `your-new-password` with your new password:

```bash
htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" your-new-password | tr -d ':\n'
```

### Step 2: Update the Password Locally 🔄

Now, navigate to the `open-webui` directory on your local machine. Update your password by replacing `HASH` with the bcrypt hash from Step 1 and `admin@example.com` with your admin account email, and execute:

```bash
sqlite3 backend/data/webui.db "UPDATE auth SET password='HASH' WHERE email='admin@example.com';"
```
