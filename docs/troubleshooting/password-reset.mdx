# Resetting Your Admin Password üóùÔ∏è

If you've forgotten your admin password, don't worry! Below you'll find step-by-step guides to reset your admin password for Podman ü¶≠ and Docker üê≥ deployments and local installations of Open WebUI.

## For Podman ü¶≠ or Docker üê≥ Deployments

Follow these steps to reset the admin password for Open WebUI when deployed using Podman or Docker.

### Step 1: Generate a New Password Hash üîê

First, you need to create a bcrypt hash of your new password. Run the following command on your local machine, replacing `your-new-password` with the password you wish to use:

```bash
htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" your-new-password | tr -d ':\n'
```

**Note:** The output will include a bcrypt hash with special characters that need to be handled carefully. Any `$` characters in the hash will need to be escaped or triple-escaped based on your system (replaced with `\` or `\\\`) to be used correctly in the final step.

### Step 2: Install sqlite3 on your machine (optional, if already installed)

Installation on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install sqlite3
```

Installation on RHEL:

```bash
sudo yum install sqlite
```

### Step 3: Get the path to the database file (optional, if known)

For Podman ü¶≠:

```bash
podman volume inspect open-webui
```

For Docker üê≥:

```bash
docker volume inspect open-webui
```

Copy the mount point and test if you can access the path and the database file itself.
To test if you can access the path:

```bash
sudo ls -l MOUNTINGPOINT_PATH
```

To test if you have access to the DB file:

```bash
sudo sqlite3 /MOUNTINGPOINT_PATH/webui.db "SELECT email, password FROM auth WHERE email='EMAIL';"
```

**Note:** Insert the path and enter the email address you want to check the hash for.

### Step 4: Update the password in the database üîÑ

Next, you'll update the password in your Podman or Docker deployment. Replace `HASH` in the command below with the bcrypt hash generated in Step 1, making sure to escape any `$` characters. Also, replace `EMAIL` with the email address linked to your admin account.

```bash
echo "UPDATE auth SET password='HASH' WHERE email='EMAIL';" | sudo sqlite3 /MOUNTINGPOINT_PATH/webui.db
```

**Important:** The following command may not work in all cases. If it doesn't work for you, please try to escape or triple-escape the `$` characters. This varies between systems! You can verify whether the escaping was successful using the following command:

```bash
sudo sqlite3 /MOUNTINGPOINT_PATH/webui.db "SELECT email, password FROM auth WHERE email='EMAIL';"
```

The output should return the email address and the hash you generated in Step 1 ‚Äî if the output differs from that hash, it‚Äôs not going to work. Check if there are backslashes in the output and adjust the command if necessary.


## For Local Installations üíª

If you have a local installation of Open WebUI, here's how you can reset your admin password directly on your system.

### Step 1: Generate a New Password Hash üîê

Just as with the Docker method, start by generating a bcrypt hash of your new password using the following command. Remember to replace `your-new-password` with your new password:

```bash
htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" your-new-password | tr -d ':\n'
```

### Step 2: Update the Password Locally üîÑ

Now, navigate to the `open-webui` directory on your local machine. Update your password by replacing `HASH` with the bcrypt hash from Step 1 and `admin@example.com` with your admin account email, and execute:

```bash
sqlite3 backend/data/webui.db "UPDATE auth SET password='HASH' WHERE email='admin@example.com';"
```


#### Alternate Docker Method

_If you have issues with the above._  I had issues chaining the `bash` commands in `alpine/socat`, _since `bash` doesn't exist._

1. **Run `alpine` linux connected to the open-webui volume.**

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm -v open-webui:/path/to/data alpine
    ```
    _`/path/to/data` depends on __your__ volume settings._

    1. Install `apache2-utils` and `sqlite`:

        ```sh
        apk add apache2-utils sqlite
        ```
    1. Generate `bcrypt` hash:

        ```sh
        htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" your-new-password | tr -d ':'
        ```

    1. Update password:

        ```sh
        sqlite3 /path/to/data/webui.db
        ```

        ```sql
        UPDATE auth SET password='HASH' WHERE email='admin@example.com';
        -- exit sqlite: [Ctrl + d]
        ```
## Nuking All the Data

If you want to **completely reset** Open WebUI‚Äîincluding all user data, settings, and passwords‚Äîfollow these steps to remove the `webui.db` file.

### Step 1: Locate `webui.db` in Your Python Environment

If you‚Äôre unsure where `webui.db` is located (especially if you're using a virtual environment), you can find out by following these steps:

1. Activate your virtual environment (if applicable).
2. Open a Python shell:
   python

3. Run the following code inside the Python shell:
```
   import os
   import open_webui

   # Show where the Open WebUI package is installed
   print("Open WebUI is installed at:", open_webui.__file__)

   # Construct a potential path to webui.db (commonly located in 'data/webui.db')
   db_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(open_webui.__file__), "data", "webui.db")
   print("Potential path to webui.db:", db_path)

   # Check if webui.db exists at that path
   if os.path.exists(db_path):
       print("webui.db found at:", db_path)
   else:
       print("webui.db not found at:", db_path)
```
4. Examine the output:
   - If the file is found, you‚Äôll see its exact path.
   - If not, you may need to perform a broader filesystem search (e.g., using `find` on Linux or a global file search on Windows/Mac).

### Step 2: Delete `webui.db`

Once you‚Äôve located the file, remove it using a command similar to:

```
   rm -rf /path/to/your/python/environment/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/open_webui/data/webui.db
```

**Warning:** Deleting `webui.db` will remove all stored data, including user accounts, settings, and passwords. Only do this if you truly want to start fresh!

        


üìñ By following these straightforward steps, you'll regain access to your Open WebUI admin account in no time. If you encounter any issues during the process, please consider searching for your issue on forums or community platforms.
