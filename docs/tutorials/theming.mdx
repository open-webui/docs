# Customizing and Adding New Themes

Open WebUI supports a variety of themes to customize your experience. This guide explains how you can contribute your own themes, particularly animated themes powered by [Particle.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) or custom animations.

## For Users: Proposing New Themes

If you are not a developer but have a great idea for a new animated theme, we'd love to hear it! The best way to contribute is to:

1.  Find a cool Particle.js configuration you like. You can explore examples on sites like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tag/particles.js).
2.  Open a "Feature Request" issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues).
3.  In your request, include a link to the Particle.js configuration you'd like to see added as a theme.

## For Developers: Adding a New Theme

If you are a developer, you can add new themes directly to the project. The process has been streamlined to be as simple as possible.

### Step 1: Create Your Theme File

Every theme is defined in a single TypeScript file.

1.  **Create the Theme File:**
    *   Navigate to `src/lib/themes/definitions/`.
    *   Create a new file named after your theme (e.g., `my-cool-theme.ts`).

2.  **Define Your Theme:**
    *   In your new file, import the `Theme` type and define your theme object.
    *   The theme object should have the following properties:
        *   `id`: A unique identifier for your theme (e.g., `'my-cool-theme'`).
        *   `name`: A user-friendly name for your theme (e.g., `'My Cool Theme'`).
        *   `emoji`: An emoji to represent your theme in the UI.
        *   `metaThemeColor`: The hex color for the browser's UI elements (e.g., `'#000000'`).
        *   `particleConfig` (optional): The `particles.js` configuration object. Use this for standard particle-based themes.
        *   `animation` (optional): An object with `start` and `stop` functions for custom canvas animations.
        *   `css`: A string containing the CSS for your theme.

### Example: Particle.js Theme

Here is an example of a simple `particles.js` theme:

```typescript
import type { Theme } from '$lib/types';

export const myCoolTheme: Theme = {
  id: 'my-cool-theme',
  name: 'My Cool Theme',
  emoji: 'ðŸ˜Ž',
  metaThemeColor: '#000000',
  particleConfig: {
    particles: {
      number: { value: 80, density: { enable: true, value_area: 800 } },
      color: { value: '#ffffff' },
      shape: { type: 'circle' },
      opacity: { value: 0.5, random: false },
      size: { value: 3, random: true },
      line_linked: { enable: true, distance: 150, color: '#ffffff', opacity: 0.4, width: 1 },
      move: { enable: true, speed: 1, direction: 'none', random: false, straight: false, out_mode: 'out' }
    }
  },
  css: `
    #main-container.my-cool-theme-bg {
      background-color: #000 !important;
      isolation: isolate;
      position: relative;
    }

    #particles-js {
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      z-index: -1;
    }
  `
};
```

### Example: Custom Animation Theme

Here is an example of a theme with a custom canvas animation:

```typescript
import type { Theme } from '$lib/types';

const startAnimation = (canvas: HTMLCanvasElement) => {
  // Your animation logic here
};

const stopAnimation = () => {
  // Your cleanup logic here
};

export const myCustomAnimationTheme: Theme = {
  id: 'my-custom-animation-theme',
  name: 'My Custom Animation',
  emoji: 'ðŸŽ¨',
  metaThemeColor: '#123456',
  animation: {
    start: startAnimation,
    stop: stopAnimation
  },
  css: `
    #main-container.my-custom-animation-theme-bg {
      background-color: #123456 !important;
    }
  `
};
```

That's it! The application will automatically discover and register your new theme. It will appear in the theme dropdown in the settings.
