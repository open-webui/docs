# Customizing and Adding New Themes

Open WebUI supports a variety of themes to customize your experience. This guide explains how you can contribute your own themes, particularly animated themes powered by [Particle.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/).

## For Users: Proposing New Themes

If you are not a developer but have a great idea for a new animated theme, we'd love to hear it! The best way to contribute is to:

1.  Find a cool Particle.js configuration you like. You can explore examples on sites like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tag/particles.js).
2.  Open a "Feature Request" issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues).
3.  In your request, include a link to the Particle.js configuration you'd like to see added as a theme.

## For Developers: Adding a New Particle.js Theme

If you are a developer, you can add new themes directly to the project. Here is a step-by-step guide.

### Step 1: Create Your Theme Files

Every animated theme requires two files: a TypeScript configuration file and a CSS file. We have provided templates to make this easier.

1.  **Create the Configuration File:**
    *   Navigate to `src/lib/themes/`.
    *   Copy the `_template.ts` file and rename it to match your theme (e.g., `my-cool-theme.ts`).
    *   Uncomment the code inside your new file.
    *   Customize the `TEMPLATE_THEME` object with your desired Particle.js settings. You can find all available options commented within the template.
    *   Rename the exported constant from `TEMPLATE_THEME` to something unique (e.g., `MY_COOL_THEME`).

2.  **Create the CSS File:**
    *   Navigate to `static/themes/`.
    *   Copy the `_template.css` file and rename it to `my-cool-theme.css`.
    *   Uncomment the code inside the file.
    *   Change the CSS class from `.template-bg` to a name that matches your theme, for example: `#main-container.my-cool-theme-bg`. You can also change the `background-color`.

### Step 2: Register Your Theme in the Application

Next, you need to make the application aware of your new theme.

1.  **Edit `src/lib/theme.ts`:**
    *   **Import your theme config:** At the top of the file, add an import for your new theme configuration object.
        ```typescript
        import { MY_COOL_THEME } from '$lib/themes/my-cool-theme';
        ```
    *   **Add your theme to the list:** Find the `themes` array and add the name of your theme (this should match the CSS class suffix).
        ```typescript
        export const themes = [
            // ... other themes
            'my-cool-theme',
            'matrix',
            'her'
        ];
        ```
    *   **Add the theme logic:** In the `applyTheme` function, add a new `else if` block to handle your theme. This block tells the app how to apply your theme's styles and animation.
        ```typescript
        // Inside applyTheme(), after the other themes:
        } else if (_theme === 'my-cool-theme' && mainContainer) {
            manageStylesheet('my-cool-theme-stylesheet', '/themes/my-cool-theme.css', 'add');
            mainContainer.classList.add('my-cool-theme-bg');
            startParticlesJS(mainContainer, MY_COOL_THEME);
        }
        ```

### Step 3: Add Your Theme to the UI

Finally, add your theme to the dropdown menu in the settings.

1.  **Edit `src/lib/components/chat/Settings/General.svelte`:**
    *   Find the `<select>` element for themes.
    *   Add a new `<option>` element for your theme. Pick an emoji that fits!
        ```html
        <option value="my-cool-theme">My Cool Theme</option>
        ```

That's it! You have now successfully added a new animated theme to Open WebUI.
