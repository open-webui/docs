## External Web Search API

This option allows you to connect Open WebUI to your own self-hosted web search API endpoint. This is useful if you want to:

- Integrate a search engine not natively supported by Open WebUI.
- Implement custom search logic, filtering, or result processing.
- Use a private or internal search index.

### Open WebUI Setup

1. Navigate to the Open WebUI `Admin Panel`.
2. Go to the `Settings` tab and then select `Web Search`.
3. Toggle `Enable Web Search` to the on position.
4. Set `Web Search Engine` from the dropdown menu to `external`.
5. Fill `External Search URL` with the full URL of your custom search API endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/search` or `https://my-search-api.example.com/api/search`).
6. Fill `External Search API Key` with the secret API key required to authenticate with your custom search endpoint. Leave blank if your endpoint doesn't require authentication (not recommended for public endpoints).
7. Click `Save`.

### API Specification

Open WebUI will interact with your `External Search URL` as follows:

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers:**
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_EXTERNAL_SEARCH_API_KEY>`
- **Request Body (JSON):**

    ```json
    {
      "query": "The user's search query string",
      "count": 5 // The maximum number of search results requested
    }
    ```

  - `query` (string): The search term entered by the user.
  - `count` (integer): The suggested maximum number of results Open WebUI expects. Your API can return fewer results if necessary.

- **Expected Response Body (JSON):**
    Your API endpoint *must* return a JSON array of search result objects. Each object should have the following structure:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "link": "URL of the search result",
        "title": "Title of the search result page",
        "snippet": "A brief description or snippet from the search result page"
      },
      {
        "link": "...",
        "title": "...",
        "snippet": "..."
      }
      // ... potentially more results up to the requested count
    ]
    ```

  - `link` (string): The direct URL to the search result.
  - `title` (string): The title of the web page.
  - `snippet` (string): A descriptive text snippet from the page content relevant to the query.

    If an error occurs or no results are found, your endpoint should ideally return an empty JSON array `[]`.

### Example Implementation (Python/FastAPI)

Here is a simple example of a self-hosted search API using Python with FastAPI and the `duckduckgo-search` library.

```python
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI, Header, Body, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from duckduckgo_search import DDGS

EXPECTED_BEARER_TOKEN = "your_secret_token_here"

app = FastAPI()


class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
    query: str
    count: int


class SearchResult(BaseModel):
    link: str
    title: str | None
    snippet: str | None


@app.post("/search")
async def external_search(
    search_request: SearchRequest = Body(...),
    authorization: str | None = Header(None),
):
    expected_auth_header = f"Bearer {EXPECTED_BEARER_TOKEN}"
    if authorization != expected_auth_header:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Unauthorized")

    query, count = search_request.query, search_request.count

    results = []
    try:
        with DDGS() as ddgs:
            search_results = ddgs.text(
                query, safesearch="moderate", max_results=count, backend="lite"
            )

        results = [
            SearchResult(
                link=result["href"],
                title=result.get("title"),
                snippet=result.get("body"),
            )
            for result in search_results
        ]

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during DuckDuckGo search: {e}")

    return results


if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8888)
```
