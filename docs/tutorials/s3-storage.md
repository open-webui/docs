# ðŸª£ Switching to S3 Storage

This guide provides instructions on how to switch the default `local` storage in Open WebUI config to Amazon S3.

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this tutorial, you must have the following:

- An active AWS account
- An active AWS Access Key and Secret Key
- IAM permissions in AWS to create and put objects in S3
- Docker installed on your system

## What is Amazon S3

Direct from AWS' website:

"Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, cloud-native applications, backups, archive, machine learning, and analytics. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) of durability, and stores data for millions of customers all around the world."

# How to Set-Up

## 1. Required environment variables

In order to configure this option, you need to gather the following environment variables:

| **Open-WebUI Environment Variable** | **Example Value**                           |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`                  | ABC123                                      |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`              | SuperSecret                                 |
| `S3_ENDPOINT_URL`                   | https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com          |
| `S3_REGION_NAME`                    | us-east-1                                   |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME`                    | my-awesome-bucket-name                      |

- S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: This is an identifier for your AWS account's access key. You get this from the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI when creating an access key.
- S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: This is the secret part of your AWS access key pair. It's provided when you create an access key in AWS and should be stored securely.
- S3_ENDPOINT_URL: This URL directs to your S3 service endpoint and can typically be found in AWS service documentation or account settings.
- S3_REGION_NAME: This is the AWS region where your S3 bucket resides, like "us-east-1". You can identify this from the AWS Management Console under your S3 bucket details.
- S3_BUCKET_NAME: This is the unique name of your S3 bucket, which you specified when creating the bucket in AWS.

For a complete list of the available S3 endpoint URLs, see: [Amazon S3 Regular Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html)

See all the `Cloud Storage` configuration options here: [Open-WebUI Cloud Storage Config](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/env-configuration#cloud-storage)

## 2. Run Open-WebUI

Before we launch our instance of Open-WebUI, there is one final environment variable called `STORAGE_PROVIDER` we need to set. This variable tells Open-WebUI which provider you want to use. By default, `STORAGE_PROVIDER` is empty which means Open-WebUI uses local storage.

| **Storage Provider** | **Type** | **Description**                                                                                 | **Default** |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `local`              | str      | Defaults to local storage if an empty string (`' '`) is provided                                | Yes         |
| `s3`                 | str      | Uses S3 client library and related environment variables mentioned in Amazon S3 Storage         | No          |
| `gcs`                | str      | Uses GCS client library and related environment variables mentioned in Google Cloud Storage     | No          |

To use Amazon S3, we need to set `STORAGE_PROVIDER` to "S3" along with all the environment variables we gathered in Step 1 (`S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_ENDPOINT_URL`, `S3_REGION_NAME`, `S3_BUCKET_NAME`).

Here, I'm also setting the `ENV` to "dev", which will allow us to see the Open-WebUI Swagger docs so we can further test and confirm the S3 storage set-up is working as expected.

```sh
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:8080 \
  -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \
  -e STORAGE_PROVIDER="s3" \
  -e S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="ABC123" \
  -e S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="SuperSecret" \
  -e S3_ENDPOINT_URL="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com" \
  -e S3_REGION_NAME="us-east-1" \
  -e S3_BUCKET_NAME="my-awesome-bucket-name" \
  -e ENV="dev" \
  --name open-webui \
  ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```

## 3. Test the set-up

Now that we have Open-WebUI running, let's upload a simple `Hello, World` text file and test our set-up.

And confirm that we're getting a response from the selected LLM.

![Get a response in Open-WebUI](/images/tutorials/amazon-s3/amazon-s3-oui-response.png)

Great! Looks like everything is worked as expected in Open-WebUI. Now let's verify that the text file was indeed uploaded and stored in the specified S3 bucket. Using the AWS Management Console, we can see that there is now a file in the S3 bucket. In addition to the name of the file we uploaded (`hello.txt`) you can see the object's name was appended with a unique ID. This is how Open-WebUI tracks all the files uploaded.

![Get a response in Open-WebUI](/images/tutorials/amazon-s3/amazon-s3-object-in-bucket.png)

Using Open-WebUI's swagger docs, we can get all the information related to this file using the `/api/v1/files/{id}` endpoint and passing in the unique ID (4405fabb-603e-4919-972b-2b39d6ad7f5b).
