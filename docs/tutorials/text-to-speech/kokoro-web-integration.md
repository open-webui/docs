## What is `Kokoro Web`?

[Kokoro Web](https://github.com/eduardolat/kokoro-web) provides a lightweight, OpenAI-compatible API for the powerful [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) text-to-speech model, seamlessly integrating with Open WebUI to enhance your AI conversations with natural-sounding voices.

## üöÄ Two-Step Integration

### 1. Deploy Kokoro Web API (One Command)

```yaml
services:
  kokoro-web:
    image: ghcr.io/eduardolat/kokoro-web:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      # Change this to any secret key to use as your OpenAI compatible API key
      - KW_SECRET_API_KEY=your-api-key
    volumes:
      - ./kokoro-cache:/kokoro/cache
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Run with: `docker compose up -d`

### 2. Connect OpenWebUI (30 Seconds)

1. In OpenWebUI, go to `Admin Panel` ‚Üí `Settings` ‚Üí `Audio`
2. Configure:
   - Text-to-Speech Engine: `OpenAI`
   - API Base URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`  
     (If using Docker: `http://host.docker.internal:3000/api/v1`)
   - API Key: `your-api-key` (from step 1)
   - TTS Model: `model_q8f16` (best balance of size/quality)
   - TTS Voice: `af_heart` (default warm, natural english voice). You can change this to any other voice or formula from the [Kokoro Web Demo](https://voice-generator.pages.dev)

**That's it! Your OpenWebUI now has AI voice capabilities.**
