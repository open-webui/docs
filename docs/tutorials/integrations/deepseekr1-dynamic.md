title: "üêã Run DeepSeek R1 Dynamic 1.58-bit with Llama.cpp"
---

A huge shoutout to **UnslothAI** for their incredible efforts! Thanks to their hard work, we can now run the **full DeepSeek-R1** 671B parameter model in its dynamic 1.58-bit quantized form (compressed to just 131GB) on **Llama.cpp**! And the best part? You no longer have to despair about needing massive enterprise-class GPUs or servers ‚Äî it‚Äôs possible to run this model on your personal machine (albeit slowly for most consumer hardware).  

:::note
The only true **DeepSeek-R1** model on Ollama is the **671B version** available here: [https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:671b](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:671b). Other versions are **distilled** models.
:::

This guide focuses on running the **full DeepSeek-R1 Dynamic 1.58-bit quantized model** using **Llama.cpp** integrated with **Open WebUI**. For this tutorial, we‚Äôll demonstrate the steps with an **M4 Max + 128GB RAM** machine. You can adapt the settings to your own configuration.  

---

## Step 1: Install Llama.cpp  

You can either:  
- [Download the prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases)  
- **Or build it yourself**: Follow the instructions here: [Llama.cpp Build Guide](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/build.md)  

## Step 2: Download the Model Provided by UnslothAI  

Head over to [Unsloth‚Äôs Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF) and download the appropriate **dynamic quantized version** of DeepSeek-R1. For this tutorial, we‚Äôll use the **1.58-bit (131GB)** version, which is highly optimized yet remains surprisingly functional.


:::tip
Know your "working directory" ‚Äî where your Python script or terminal session is running. The model files will download to a subfolder of that directory by default, so be sure you know its path! For example, if you're running the command below in `/Users/yourname/Documents/projects`, your downloaded model will be saved under `/Users/yourname/Documents/projects/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF`. 
:::

To understand more about UnslothAI‚Äôs development process and why these dynamic quantized versions are so efficient, check out their blog post: [UnslothAI DeepSeek R1 Dynamic Quantization](https://unsloth.ai/blog/deepseekr1-dynamic).  

Here‚Äôs how to download the model programmatically:  
```python
# Install Hugging Face dependencies before running this:
# pip install huggingface_hub hf_transfer

from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

snapshot_download(
    repo_id = "unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF",  # Specify the Hugging Face repo
    local_dir = "DeepSeek-R1-GGUF",         # Model will download into this directory
    allow_patterns = ["*UD-IQ1_S*"],        # Only download the 1.58-bit version
)
```

Once the download completes, you‚Äôll find the model files in a directory structure like this:  
```
DeepSeek-R1-GGUF/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S-00001-of-00003.gguf
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S-00002-of-00003.gguf
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S-00003-of-00003.gguf
```

:::info
üõ†Ô∏è Update paths in the later steps to **match your specific directory structure**. For example, if your script was in `/Users/tim/Downloads`, the full path to the GGUF file would be:  
`/Users/tim/Downloads/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF/DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S/DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S-00001-of-00003.gguf`.
:::

## Step 3: Make Sure Open WebUI is Installed and Running  

If you don‚Äôt already have **Open WebUI** installed, no worries! It‚Äôs a simple setup. Just follow the [Open WebUI documentation here](https://docs.openwebui.com/). Once installed, start the application ‚Äî we‚Äôll connect it in a later step to interact with the DeepSeek-R1 model.  


## Step 4: Serve the Model Using Llama.cpp  

Now that the model is downloaded, the next step is to run it using **Llama.cpp‚Äôs server mode**. Before you begin:  

1. **Locate the `llama-server` binary.**  
   If you built from source (as outlined in Step 1), the `llama-server` executable will be located in `llama.cpp/build/bin`. Navigate to this directory by using the `cd` command:  
   ```bash
   cd [path-to-llama-cpp]/llama.cpp/build/bin
   ```

   Replace `[path-to-llama-cpp]` with the location where you cloned or built Llama.cpp. For example:  
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/workspace/llama.cpp/build/bin
   ```

2. **Point to your model folder.**  
   Use the full path to the downloaded GGUF files created in Step 2. When serving the model, specify the first part of the split GGUF files (e.g., `DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S-00001-of-00003.gguf`).  

Here‚Äôs the command to start the server:  
```bash
./llama-server \
    --model /[your-directory]/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF/DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S/DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S-00001-of-00003.gguf \
    --port 10000 \
    --ctx-size 1024 \
    --n-gpu-layers 40
```


:::tip
üîë **Parameters to Customize Based on Your Machine:**  

- **`--model`:** Replace `/[your-directory]/` with the path where the GGUF files were downloaded in Step 2.  
- **`--port`:** The server default is `8080`, but feel free to change it based on your port availability.  
- **`--ctx-size`:** Determines context length (number of tokens). You can increase it if your hardware allows, but be cautious of rising RAM/VRAM usage.  
- **`--n-gpu-layers`:** Set the number of layers you want to offload to your GPU for faster inference. The exact number depends on your GPU‚Äôs memory capacity ‚Äî reference Unsloth‚Äôs table for specific recommendations.
:::

For example, if your model was downloaded to `/Users/tim/Documents/workspace`, your command would look like this:  
```bash
./llama-server \
    --model /Users/tim/Documents/workspace/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF/DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S/DeepSeek-R1-UD-IQ1_S-00001-of-00003.gguf \
    --port 10000 \
    --ctx-size 1024 \
    --n-gpu-layers 40
```

Once the server starts, it will host a **local OpenAI-compatible API** endpoint at:  
```
http://127.0.0.1:10000
```

After running the command, you should see a message confirming the server is active and listening on port 10000.
:::

Be sure to **keep this terminal session running**, as it serves the model for all subsequent steps.

## Step 5: Connect Llama.cpp to Open WebUI  

1. Go to **Admin Settings** in Open WebUI.  
2. Navigate to **Connections > OpenAI Connections.**  
3. Add the following details for the new connection:  
   - URL: `http://127.0.0.1:10000/v1` (or `http://host.docker.internal:10000/v1` when running Open WebUI in docker)
   - API Key: `none`

After running the command, you should see a message confirming the server is active and listening on port 10000.

Once the connection is saved, you can start querying **DeepSeek-R1** directly from Open WebUI! üéâ

## Notes and Considerations  

- **Performance:**  
  Running a massive 131GB model like DeepSeek-R1 on personal hardware will be **slow**. Even with our M4 Max (128GB RAM), inference speeds were modest. But the fact that it works at all is a testament to UnslothAI‚Äôs optimizations.  

- **VRAM/Memory Requirements:**  
  Ensure sufficient VRAM and system RAM for optimal performance. With low-end GPUs or CPU-only setups, expect slower speeds (but it‚Äôs still doable!).  

---

Thanks to **UnslothAI** and **Llama.cpp**, running one of the largest open-source reasoning models, **DeepSeek-R1** (1.58-bit version), is finally accessible to individuals. While it‚Äôs challenging to run such models on consumer hardware, the ability to do so without massive computational infrastructure is a significant technological milestone.  

‚≠ê Big thanks to the community for pushing the boundaries of open AI research.  

Happy experimenting! üöÄ
