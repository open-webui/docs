# Local LLM Setup with IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU

:::info
[**IPEX-LLM**](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm) is a PyTorch library for running LLM on Intel CPU and GPU (e.g., local PC with iGPU, discrete GPU such as Arc A-Series, Flex and Max) with very low latency.
:::

This tutorial demonstrates how to setup Open WebUI with **IPEX-LLM accelerated Ollama backend hosted on Intel GPU**. By following this guide, you will be able to setup Open WebUI even on a low-cost PC (i.e. only with integrated GPU) with a smooth experience.

## Start Ollama Serve on Intel GPU

Refer to [this guide](https://ipex-llm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/LLM/Quickstart/ollama_quickstart.html) from IPEX-LLM official documentation about how to install and run Ollama serve accelerated by IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU.

:::tip
If you would like to reach the Ollama service from another machine, make sure you set or export the environment variable `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` before executing the command `ollama serve`.
:::

## Configure Open WebUI

Access the Ollama settings through **Settings -> Connections** in the menu. By default, the **Ollama Base URL** is preset to https://localhost:11434, as illustrated in the snapshot below. To verify the status of the Ollama service connection, click the **Refresh button** located next to the textbox. If the WebUI is unable to establish a connection with the Ollama server, you will see an error message stating, `WebUI could not connect to Ollama`.

If the connection is successful, you will see a message stating `Service Connection Verified`, as illustrated below.

:::tip
If you want to use an Ollama server hosted at a different URL, simply update the **Ollama Base URL** to the new URL and press the **Refresh** button to re-confirm the connection to Ollama.
