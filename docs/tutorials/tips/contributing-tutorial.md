   - Navigate to the [Open WebUI Docs Repository](https://github.com/open-webui/docs) on GitHub.
   - Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner to create a copy under your GitHub account.

2. **Configure GitHub Environment Variables**

   - In your forked repository, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** > **Variables**.
   - Add the following environment variables:
     - `BASE_URL` set to `/docs` (or your chosen base URL for the fork).
     - `SITE_URL` set to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/`.

3. **Enable GitHub Actions**

   - In your forked repository, navigate to the **Actions** tab.
   - If prompted, enable GitHub Actions by following the on-screen instructions.

4. **Enable GitHub Pages**
