**Workspace - Models**
=======================

The `Models` section of the `Workspace` within Open WebUI is a powerful tool that allows you to create and manage custom models tailored to specific purposes. This section serves as a central hub for all your modelfiles, providing a range of features to edit, clone, share, export, and hide your models.

### Modelfile Management

From the `Models` section, you can perform the following actions on your modelfiles:

* **Edit**: Dive into the details of your modelfile and make changes to its character and more.
* **Clone**: Create a copy of a modelfile, which will be appended with `-clone` to the cloned `Model ID`. Note that you cannot clone a base model; you must create a model first before cloning it.
* **Share**: Share your modelfile with the Open WebUI community by clicking the `Share` button, which will redirect you to [https://openwebui.com/models/create](https://openwebui.com/models/create).
* **Export**: Download the modelfile's `.json` export to your PC.
* **Hide**: Hide the modelfile from the model selector dropdown within chats.

### Modelfile Editing

When editing a modelfile, you can customize the following settings:

* **Avatar Photo**: Upload an avatar photo to represent your modelfile.
* **Model Name**: Change the name of your modelfile.
* **System Prompt**: Provide an optional system prompt for your modelfile.
* **Model Parameters**: Adjust the parameters of your modelfile.
* **Prompt Suggestions**: Add prompts that will be displayed on a fresh new chat page.
* **Documents**: Add documents to the modelfile (always RAG [Retrieval Augmented Generation]).
* **Tools, Filters, and Actions**: Select the tools, filters, and actions that will be available to the modelfile.
* **Vision**: Toggle to enable `Vision` for multi-modals.
* **Tags**: Add tags to the modelfile that will be displayed beside the model name in the model selector dropdown.

### Model Discovery and Import/Export

The `Models` section also includes features for discovering, importing, and exporting models:

* **Discover a Model**: Click this button to explore and download model presets from the Open WebUI community.
* **Import Models**: Use this button to import models from a `.json` file or other sources.
* **Export Models**: Use this button to export all your modelfiles in a single `.json` file.
