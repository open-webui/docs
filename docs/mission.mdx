## Bring Intelligence Home

The most transformative technology in human history is here. It can diagnose, discover, teach, build, and create. And right now, for most people on this planet, it lives behind someone else's login page, on someone else's servers, under someone else's rules.

We're changing that.

**Open WebUI is building toward a future where every person has their own AI that truly knows them, runs on their own hardware, and goes wherever they go.**

Picture what that means.

A doctor's AI that has read every chart in the hospital, catches a dangerous drug interaction before the prescription is signed, and never sends a byte of patient data outside the building. A teacher's AI that knows every student's strengths and weak spots and has tomorrow's lesson plan ready before the school day starts. A disaster coordinator's AI that runs on a laptop with no internet and still knows exactly where to send water because it has every supply manifest and damage report loaded locally.

An engineer's AI on Mars that diagnoses a failing CO2 scrubber from maintenance logs alone, because there is no cloud twenty-two light-minutes from Earth.

All of this becomes possible when AI has **context**: your documents, your history, your tools, your memory, your world. And all of it requires one thing: that the AI lives with you, on your machine, under your control. Not visiting someone else's service. Home.

That is what Open WebUI is. A home for AI. The place where your AI's knowledge, memory, tools, and skills accumulate over time into something that understands your work as deeply as you do. Something that doesn't just answer when asked, but anticipates what you need and acts.

It works with any model. It runs on your hardware. It scales from one person to thousands. And it is open source, because we believe this technology should belong to everyone.

**Our mission is to bring AI to every person and every organization on Earth, and everywhere beyond it.**
