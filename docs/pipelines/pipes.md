# Pipes
Pipes are functions that can be used to perform actions prior to returning LLM messages to the user. Examples of potential actions you can take with Pipes are Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), sending requests to non-OpenAI LLM providers (such as Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, or Google), or executing functions right in your web UI. A list of examples is maintained in the [Pipelines repo](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines/tree/main/examples/pipelines).
