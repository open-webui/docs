# Actions
Action functions allow you to write custom buttons to the message toolbar for end users to interact with. This feature enables more interactive messaging, enabling users to grant permission before a task is performed, generate visualizations of structured data, download an audio snippet of chats, and many other use cases. An example of a graph vizualization Action can be seen in the video below.
