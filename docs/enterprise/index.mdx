## **Keep Open WebUI Thriving: Support Continuous Innovation** 

:::tip
Even if you **don’t need an enterprise license**, consider becoming a **sponsor** to help fund continuous development. 

It’s an **investment in stability, longevity, and ongoing improvements**. A well-funded Open WebUI means **fewer bugs, fewer security concerns, and a more feature-rich platform** that stays ahead of industry trends. The cost of sponsoring is **a fraction of what it would take to build, maintain, and support an equivalent AI system internally.** 
:::


You can use Open WebUI for free, no strings attached. However, building, maintaining, supporting, and evolving such a powerful AI platform requires **significant effort, time, and resources**. Infrastructure costs, security updates, continuous improvements, and keeping up with the latest AI advancements all demand **dedicated engineering, operational, and research efforts**.  

If Open WebUI helps your business save time, money, or resources, we **encourage** you to consider supporting its development. As an **independently funded** project, sponsorship enables us to maintain **a fast iteration cycle to keep up with the rapid advancements in AI**. Your support directly contributes to critical features, security enhancements, performance improvements, and integrations that benefit everyone—including **you**. Open WebUI will continue to offer the same feature set without requiring an enterprise license, ensuring **accessibility for all users**.

💙 **[Sponsor Open WebUI](https://github.com/sponsors/tjbck)** – Join our existing backers in keeping Open WebUI thriving.  

Whether through **enterprise partnerships, contributions, or financial backing**, your support plays a crucial role in sustaining this powerful AI platform for businesses **worldwide**.
