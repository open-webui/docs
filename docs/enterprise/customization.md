### White-Labeling & Custom Theming

For organizations deploying AI tools to internal teams, or offering AI capabilities to clients, brand consistency matters. Open WebUI's enterprise licensing enables full white-labeling capabilities:

| Capability | What You Can Customize |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Visual Identity** | Replace default branding with your organization's logo, colors, and visual style. |
| **Interface Theming** | Customize the look and feel to match your existing internal tools. |
| **User Experience** | Tailor the interface to emphasize the workflows most relevant to your teams. |

#### Why This Matters

When AI tools look and feel like part of your existing ecosystem, adoption increases. Users don't experience cognitive friction switching between "your tools" and "that AI thing", it becomes one seamless environment.

### What This Means for Your Organization

#### For Product Owners

You are not forcing teams to adapt to the tool, the tool adapts to them. Customization options mean you can roll out AI capabilities that feel native to each department's workflow.

#### For IT Teams

Integration flexibility means Open WebUI slots into your existing architecture. You are not rebuilding identity management, recreating monitoring dashboards, or maintaining yet another authentication silo.

#### For Brand & Communications Teams

White-labeling ensures AI tools meet the same brand standards as every other internal platform. No awkward "third-party app" aesthetic undermining your carefully maintained internal experience.
