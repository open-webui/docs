# Integration & Customization

## Make Open WebUI Your Own

Off-the-shelf software rarely fits enterprise workflows perfectly. Teams have established processes, specific model requirements, and brand standards that generic tools can't accommodate.

Open WebUI is built differently. From the interface your users see to the AI models powering their work, every layer is designed for customization—without requiring you to fork the codebase or maintain a separate build.

---

## AI Model Integration

### Connect Any Model to Any Workflow

Your organization's AI needs are unique. Maybe you have fine-tuned models on proprietary data. Perhaps you are committed to specific providers for compliance reasons. Or you need different models for different use cases across departments.

Open WebUI supports flexible model integration:

*   **Proprietary Models** — Connect models you have developed or fine-tuned specifically for your organization's domain.
*   **Third-Party Providers** — Integrate commercial AI services that meet your compliance and performance requirements.
*   **Local Models** — Run models entirely on-premise for maximum data control and reduced latency.
*   **Multi-Model Environments** — Offer different models to different teams, or build multi-model agentic workflows based on specific needs.

### Model Optimization for Enterprise Workflows

Beyond basic connectivity, Open WebUI's enterprise offerings include guidance on optimizing model performance for your specific use cases:

*   **Fine-Tuning Consultation** — Work with our team to optimize models for your domain vocabulary and use patterns.
*   **Performance Benchmarking** — Understand how different models perform against your actual workflow requirements.
*   **Cost Optimization** — Balance model capability against token costs for sustainable deployment at scale.

## White-Labeling & Custom Theming

### Your Brand, Your Platform

For organizations deploying AI tools to internal teams—or offering AI capabilities to clients—brand consistency matters. Open WebUI's enterprise licensing enables full white-labeling capabilities:

| Capability | What You Can Customize |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Visual Identity** | Replace default branding with your organization's logo, colors, and visual style. |
| **Interface Theming** | Customize the look and feel to match your existing internal tools. |
| **Naming & Terminology** | Adapt the interface language to align with your organization's conventions. |
| **User Experience** | Tailor the interface to emphasize the workflows most relevant to your teams. |

:::info Enterprise License Required
White-labeling and custom theming capabilities require an enterprise license. The standard version must retain Open WebUI branding as specified in the design guidelines.

### Why This Matters

When AI tools look and feel like part of your existing ecosystem, adoption increases. Users don't experience cognitive friction switching between "your tools" and "that AI thing"—it becomes one seamless environment.

## Extensibility & Platform Integration

### Built to Extend, Not Replace

Enterprise software ecosystems are complex. The last thing you need is another silo. Open WebUI's modular architecture means it works *with* your existing infrastructure, not against it:

| Integration Type | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Identity Systems** | LDAP, Active Directory, SSO providers (SAML, OIDC). |
| **Enterprise Tools** | Connect to internal APIs, databases, and business systems. |
| **Workflow Automation** | Integrate with existing automation pipelines and orchestration tools. |
| **Observability** | Feed logs and metrics into your existing monitoring stack. |

### Extend Without Forking

Open WebUI's plugin and pipeline architecture allows you to add functionality without modifying core code:

*   **Custom Workflows** — Build organization-specific AI workflows that reflect your actual business processes.
*   **Data Connectors** — Create integrations that pull context from your internal knowledge bases.
*   **Specialized Interfaces** — Develop custom UI components for specific departmental needs.
*   **Automation Hooks** — Trigger actions in external systems based on AI interactions.

This approach protects your investment. **Core Open WebUI updates do not break your customizations**, and your customizations do not prevent you from receiving security patches and new features.

## What This Means for Your Organization

### For Product Owners
You are not forcing teams to adapt to the tool—the tool adapts to them. Customization options mean you can roll out AI capabilities that feel native to each department's workflow.

### For IT Teams
Integration flexibility means Open WebUI slots into your existing architecture. You are not rebuilding identity management, recreating monitoring dashboards, or maintaining yet another authentication silo.

### For Brand & Communications Teams
White-labeling ensures AI tools meet the same brand standards as every other internal platform. No awkward "third-party app" aesthetic undermining your carefully maintained internal experience.

## Planning Your Customization

The right level of customization depends on your organization's specific needs. Some enterprises need only basic theming; others require deep integrations with proprietary systems.

For organizations planning significant customization, we recommend:

1.  **Inventory your requirements** — What must integrate? What should match your brand? What workflows need support?
2.  **Review existing capabilities** — Many customizations are possible through configuration rather than development.
3.  **Contact our Enterprise team** — For complex integrations or white-labeling, we can scope the effort together.
