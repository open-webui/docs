## Built for Open Access

:::info
Open WebUI is **free to use** and our source code is publicly available. You can deploy it today without an enterprise agreement.

We believe in democratizing access to AI. The Enterprise offerings above provide **governance, white labeling, liability protection, and dedicated support** for organizations that require them—but the core platform remains free and accessible to our community.

## Keep Open WebUI Thriving ❤️

Even if you don't need enterprise support, consider becoming a sponsor to help fund continuous development.

Open WebUI is free to use, but building, maintaining, and improving a platform of this scale takes real time, resources, and ongoing engineering work. Sponsorships help fund stability, security, new features, and long-term development—at a fraction of what it would cost to build and maintain an equivalent system in-house.
