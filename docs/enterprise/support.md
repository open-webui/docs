## What This Means for Your Organization

### For IT Operations

You are not navigating deployment challenges alone. Direct access to the Open WebUI team means faster resolution and guidance informed by deep platform expertise.

### For Procurement & Legal

Enterprise support provides a formal relationship with the organization behind the platform—documented, accountable, and structured with Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

### For Executive Leadership

Enterprise support de-risks your AI investment. You have a direct relationship with the team building and maintaining Open WebUI, ensuring long-term viability.

## Keep Open WebUI Thriving ❤️

Even if you don't need enterprise support, consider becoming a sponsor to help fund continuous development.

Open WebUI is free to use, but building, maintaining, and improving a platform of this scale takes real time, resources, and ongoing engineering work. Sponsorships help fund stability, security, new features, and long-term development—at a fraction of what it would cost to build and maintain an equivalent system in-house.
