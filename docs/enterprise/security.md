# Security & Governance

## Enterprise-Grade Security Without Compromise

For enterprise organizations, AI adoption isn't just a technology decision—it's a security decision. Every model query, every document uploaded, and every workflow automated represents data that needs protection.

Open WebUI is built with security as a foundational principle. Whether you are navigating strict regulatory requirements or simply committed to protecting your organization's intellectual property, Open WebUI provides the controls necessary to deploy AI confidently.

## Security Architecture

### Your Data, Your Infrastructure

Unlike SaaS AI platforms where your data traverses third-party servers, Open WebUI gives you **complete control over your data pipeline**:

| Deployment Model | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **On-Premise** | Run entirely within your own data centers—nothing leaves your network. |
| **Private Cloud** | Deploy in your organization's cloud tenancy (AWS, Azure, GCP) with full infrastructure control. |
| **Air-Gapped** | Complete network isolation for environments with the strictest security requirements. |
| **Hybrid** | Flexible configurations that balance accessibility with security boundaries. |

For organizations handling sensitive data—whether proprietary research, customer information, or classified materials—this architecture ensures your AI capabilities never compromise your security posture.

## Compliance Frameworks

Open WebUI is designed to support organizations operating under rigorous compliance requirements. The platform's architecture and controls align with major compliance frameworks, including:

*   **SOC 2** — Operational compliance demonstrating reliability, integrity, and security.
*   **HIPAA** — Healthcare data protection requirements for covered entities.
*   **GDPR** — European data protection and privacy regulations.
*   **FedRAMP** — Federal security standards for cloud services used by US government agencies.
*   **ISO 27001** — International standard for information security management systems.

:::tip Compliance is a Partnership
Open WebUI provides the **technical controls and architecture** to support these frameworks. Achieving certification requires proper configuration, organizational policies, and often third-party audits specific to your deployment.

## Identity & Access Management

Seamless integration with your existing identity infrastructure eliminates friction while maintaining security boundaries.

### Enterprise Identity Integration

Open WebUI integrates with the identity systems your organization already uses [2]:

*   **LDAP & Active Directory** — Connect directly to your existing directory services for user authentication and management.
*   **Single Sign-On (SSO)** — Support for SAML and OIDC protocols, enabling users to access Open WebUI with their existing corporate credentials.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** — Layer additional security on top of primary authentication.

### Access Control & Permissions

Beyond authentication, Open WebUI provides granular control over user permissions:

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — Define roles that align with your organizational structure to limit administrative access.
*   **Model-Level Permissions** — Control which users or groups can access specific AI models.
*   **Workspace Isolation** — Separate teams or departments to prevent unauthorized data access.

## Data Governance

### Audit & Accountability

For regulated industries and security-conscious organizations, visibility into system usage is not optional. Open WebUI supports standard enterprise logging patterns:

*   **Infrastructure-Level Logging** — Containerized architecture allows standard output streams to be piped directly to your logging infrastructure (Splunk, Datadog, ELK).
*   **Event Tracking** — Track API usage and system events to monitor for anomalies.
*   **retention Controls** — Because you own the database, you control the data retention policies, ensuring data is purged or archived according to your compliance schedules.

### Data Residency

For organizations with geographic data requirements—whether driven by GDPR, data sovereignty laws, or internal policy—Open WebUI's flexible deployment options ensure your data stays physically located where it is legally required to be.

## What This Means for Your Organization

### For Security Teams
You are not introducing a "black box" into your environment. Open WebUI's architecture gives you visibility and control, integrating with your existing security tooling rather than creating blind spots.

### For Compliance Officers
The technical controls exist to support your compliance posture. Whether you are preparing for an audit or responding to a security questionnaire, Open WebUI's architecture provides defensible answers.

### For IT Leadership
User management doesn't become another silo. Open WebUI works with your existing identity infrastructure, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring consistent access policies across your tooling.

## Planning Your Secure Deployment

Security requirements vary significantly across industries. The right configuration depends on your specific threat model, compliance obligations, and operational needs.

For organizations with complex security requirements, we recommend:

1.  **Review the Getting Started Guide** for foundational deployment concepts.
2.  **Assess your compliance requirements** and identify which frameworks apply to your deployment.
3.  **Contact our Enterprise team** for guidance on security-hardened configurations.
