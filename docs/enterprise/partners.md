# Partnership & Reseller Guidelines

We carefully select our partners to maintain the highest standards and provide the best experience to our community.

## For Agencies and Solutions Providers

If you are a **consulting agency**, **AI services provider**, or **reseller**, please **do not** contact enterprise sales directly. As noted in our guidelines, direct sales inquiries from agencies may not receive a response [2].

Instead, we ask that you **fill out our partnership interest form**:

🔗 **[Apply to Partner Network](https://forms.gle/SemdgxjFXpHmdCby6)**

### Eligibility & Expectations
To ensure alignment with our mission, please note the following criteria for partners:

*   **Company Maturity:** We prioritize mature organizations. Generally, companies **less than 5 years old are not eligible** except in exceptional cases [2].
*   **Capacity:** Our program receives a high volume of requests. Being on the waitlist **does not guarantee a response** [2].
*   **Communication:** Please **do not follow up** or send additional messages after applying [2].

## Direct Client Deployments

If you have an **end-client** who is ready to move forward and is committed to purchasing an **Enterprise License** immediately, you may facilitate the introduction.

Please contact us directly with:
1.  Your agency details.
2.  The client's company name and official work email domain.
3.  The expected number of end users (seats) to be deployed [2].
