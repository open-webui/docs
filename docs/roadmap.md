- 🧠 **Long-Term Memory**: Witness the power of persistent memory in our agents. Enjoy conversations that feel continuous as agents remember and reference past interactions, creating a more cohesive and personalized user experience.
- 🧪 **Research-Centric Features**: Empower researchers in the fields of LLM and HCI with a comprehensive web UI for conducting user studies. Stay tuned for ongoing feature enhancements (e.g., surveys, analytics, and participant tracking) to facilitate their research.
- 📈 **User Study Tools**: Providing specialized tools, like heat maps and behavior tracking modules, to empower researchers in capturing and analyzing user behavior patterns with precision and accuracy.
- 📚 **Enhanced Documentation**: Elevate your setup and customization experience with improved, comprehensive documentation.

Feel free to contribute and help us make Open WebUI even better! 🙌
