#### 🌐 Q: Why isn't my local OpenAPI tool server accessible from the WebUI interface?

**A:** If your tool server is running locally (e.g. http://localhost:8000), browser-based clients may be restricted from accessing it due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies.

Make sure to explicitly enable CORS headers in your OpenAPI server. For example, if you're using FastAPI, you can add:

```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # or specify your client origin
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

Also, if Open WebUI is served over HTTPS (e.g. https://yourdomain.com), your local server must meet one of the following conditions:

- Be accessed from the same domain using HTTPS (e.g. https://localhost:8000).
- OR run on localhost (127.0.0.1) to allow browsers to relax security for local development.
- Otherwise, browsers may block insecure requests from HTTPS pages to HTTP APIs due to mixed-content rules.

To work securely in production over HTTPS, your OpenAPI servers must also be served over HTTPS.

#### 🚀 Q: Do I need to use FastAPI for my server implementation?

**A:**  No! While our reference implementations are written using FastAPI for clarity and ease of use, you can use any framework or language that produces a valid OpenAPI (Swagger) specification. Some common choices include:

- FastAPI (Python)
- Flask + Flask-RESTX (Python)
- Express + Swagger UI (JavaScript/Node)
- Spring Boot (Java)
- Go with Swag or Echo

The key is to ensure your server exposes a valid OpenAPI schema, and that it communicates over HTTP(S).
It is important to set a custom operationId for all endpoints.

#### 🚀 Q: Why choose OpenAPI over MCP?

**A:** OpenAPI wins over MCP in most real-world scenarios due to its simplicity, tooling ecosystem, stability, and developer-friendliness. Here's why:

- ✅ **Reuse Your Existing Code**: If you’ve built REST APIs before, you're mostly done—you don’t need to rewrite your logic. Just define a compliant OpenAPI spec and expose your current code as a tool server.

  With MCP, you had to reimplement your tool logic inside a custom protocol layer, duplicating work and increasing the surface area to maintain.

- 💼 **Less to Maintain & Debug**: OpenAPI fits naturally into modern dev workflows. You can test endpoints with Postman, inspect logs with built-in APIs, troubleshoot easily with mature ecosystem tools—and often without modifying your core app at all.

  MCP introduced new layers of transport, schema parsing, and runtime quirks, all of which had to be debugged manually.

- 🌍 **Standards-Based**: OpenAPI is widely adopted across the tech industry. Its well-defined structure means tools, agents, and servers can interoperate immediately, without needing special bridges or translations.

- 🧰 **Better Tooling**: There’s an entire universe of tools that support OpenAPI—automatic client/server generation, documentation, validation, mocking, testing, and even security audit tools.

- 🔐 **First-Class Security Support**: OpenAPI includes native support for things like OAuth2, JWTs, API Keys, and HTTPS—making it easier to build secure endpoints with common libraries and standards.

- 🧠 **More Devs Already Know It**: Using OpenAPI means you're speaking a language already familiar to backend teams, frontend developers, DevOps, and product engineers. There’s no learning curve or costly onboarding required.

- 🔄 **Future-Proof & Extensible**: OpenAPI evolves with API standards and remains forward-compatible. MCP, by contrast, was bespoke and experimental—often requiring changes as the surrounding ecosystem changed.

🧵 Bottom line: OpenAPI lets you do more with less effort, less code duplication, and fewer surprises. It’s a production-ready, developer-friendly route to powering LLM tools—without rebuilding everything from scratch.

#### 🔐 Q: How do I secure my OpenAPI tool server?

**A:** OpenAPI supports industry-standard security mechanisms like:

- OAuth 2.0
- API Key headers
- JWT (JSON Web Token)
- Basic Auth

Use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit, and restrict endpoints with proper auth/authz methods as appropriate. You can incorporate these directly in your OpenAPI schema using the securitySchemes field.

---

#### ❓ Q: What kind of tools can I build using OpenAPI tool servers?

**A:** If it can be exposed via a REST API, you can build it. Common tool types include:

- Filesystem operations (read/write files, list directories)
- Git and document repository access
- Database querying or schema exploration
- Web scrapers or summarizers
- External SaaS integrations (e.g., Salesforce, Jira, Slack)
- LLM-attached memory stores / RAG components
- Secure internal microservices exposed to your agent

---

#### 🔌 Q: Can I run more than one tool server at the same time?

**A:** Absolutely. Each tool server runs independently and exposes its own OpenAPI schema. Your agent configuration can point to multiple tool servers, allowing you to mix and match based on need.

There's no limit—just ensure each server runs on its own port or address and is reachable by the agent host.

---

#### 🧪 Q: How do I test a tool server before linking it to an LLM agent?

**A:** You can test your OpenAPI tool servers using:

- Swagger UI or ReDoc (built into FastAPI by default)
- Postman or Insomnia
- curl or httpie from the command line
- Python’s requests module
- OpenAPI validators and mockers

Once validated, you can register the tool server with an LLM agent or through Open WebUI.

---

#### 🛠️ Q: Can I extend or customize the reference servers?

**A:** Yes! All servers in the servers/ directory are built to be simple templates. Fork and modify them to:

- Add new endpoints and business logic
- Integrate authentication
- Change response formats
- Connect to new services or internal APIs
- Deploy via Docker, Kubernetes, or any cloud host

---

#### 🌍 Q: Can I run OpenAPI tool servers on cloud platforms like AWS or GCP?

**A:** Yes. These servers are plain HTTP services. You can deploy them as:

- AWS Lambda with API Gateway (serverless)
- EC2 or GCP Compute Engine instances
- Kubernetes services in GKE/EKS/AKS
- Cloud Run or App Engine
- Render, Railway, Heroku, etc.

Just make sure they’re securely configured and publicly reachable (or VPN'd) if needed by the agent or user.

#### 🧪 Q: What if I have an existing MCP server?

**A:** Great news! You can use our MCP-to-OpenAPI Bridge: [mcpo](https://github.com/open-webui/mcpo), exposing your existing MCP-based tools as OpenAPI-compatible APIs is now easier than ever. No rewrites, no headaches — just plug and go! 🚀

If you've already built tools using the MCP protocol, `mcpo` helps you instantly unlock compatibility with Open WebUI and any OpenAPI-based agent — ensuring your hard work remains fully accessible and future-ready.

[Check out the optional Bridge to MCP section in the docs for setup instructions.](https://github.com/open-webui/openapi-servers?tab=readme-ov-file#-bridge-to-mcp-optional)

**Quick Start:**
```bash
uvx mcpo --port 8000 -- uvx mcp-server-time --local-timezone=America/New_York
```

✨ That’s it — your MCP server is now OpenAPI-ready!

---

#### 🗂️ Q: Can one OpenAPI server implement multiple tools?

**A:** Yes. A single OpenAPI server can offer multiple related capabilities grouped under different endpoints. For example, a document server may provide search, upload, OCR, and summarization—all within one schema.

You can also modularize completely by creating one OpenAPI server per tool if you prefer isolation and flexibility.
