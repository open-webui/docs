# Open WebUI and NVIDIA DGX Spark: Powering the Next Chapter of Local AI

![Open WebUI on NVIDIA DGX Spark](/images/blog/open-webui-nvidia-dgx-spark/dgx-spark.png)

At Open WebUI, our mission has always been simple: empower anyone, anywhere, to harness the full potential of AI, without depending on centralized infrastructure. We believe that meaningful, intelligent systems should be accessible, personal, and under your control. Computers purpose built for AI like **NVIDIA DGXâ„¢ Spark** make this vision more tangible than ever before.

### A Foundation for Democratized Intelligence

Modern AI is reshaping how we interact with knowledge, create content, and collaborate. But accessibility and autonomy remain essential. Open WebUI was designed around that principle, an open-source, self-hosted platform that lets individuals and organizations build their own intelligent environments, locally or in the cloud.

With DGX Spark, this vision steps up to a new level. The systemâ€™s raw computational power and energy-efficient design unlock incredible local  performance. It brings the benefits of open-weight models like **GPT-OSS, Llama or Qwen** directly into your workspace, enabling real-time reasoning, content generation, and collaboration, all without leaving your own network.

### From Setup to Scale in Minutes

True accessibility starts with simplicity. Getting started with Open WebUI on DGX Spark is as easy as:

```sh
pip install open-webui
open-webui serve
```

Or, if you prefer containerized deployment:

```sh
docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
```
 
Thatâ€™s it. In just a few commands, you can launch a fully interactive, locally hosted AI environment, ready to serve models, collaborate with teams, or even power autonomous AI agents. No external dependencies. No gatekeepers. Just open infrastructure and full control.

### Building Smarter, Smaller, Stronger Networks

Weâ€™ve long said that **small doesnâ€™t mean weak, it means personal**. AI has erased the traditional limits of scale. A personal AI supercomputer, like DGX Spark, can now host a vibrant, intelligent network, supporting research teams, creative collectives, or entire classrooms. Whether online or offline, Open WebUI provides the tools to interact, learn, and create freely.

This synergy, high-performance local compute from NVIDIA paired with the open accessibility of Open WebUI, moves us closer to a future where AI belongs to everyone. Itâ€™s not just about faster inference or more powerful models; itâ€™s about ensuring that innovation remains open, distributed, and human-centered.

### The Road Ahead

NVIDIA DGX Spark marks another important step toward democratizing AI infrastructure. It shows that high-end compute and open software donâ€™t have to live in separate worlds, they can thrive together. Whether youâ€™re experimenting, building, or scaling your next idea, Open WebUI and DGX Spark give you the foundation to do so freely and independently.

Weâ€™re proud to see our platform running on DGX Spark hardware as part of this next chapter in open, decentralized AI. The future of intelligent systems is not somewhere distant, itâ€™s right here, in your hands.
